\section{Comparisons with UVIS occultations and GCM predictions}
\label{seq:comparisons}

\cite{West2018} already confirmed the excellent agreement between the observations made during
two Voyager flybys and the position of the detached haze layer one Titan year later.
Comparisons with Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and
Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) instruments, could be possible but
they are limited by the sensitivity of their detectors above 450 km where the detached haze is located.
Therefore, we only performed a comparison with two stellar occultations
made by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) instrument in 2009 \citep{Koskinen2011}.
The extinction profiles retrieved in the previous sections can also be compared with results
obtained with other instruments and with Global Circulation Model (GCM) predictions.
