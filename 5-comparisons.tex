\section{Comparisons with UVIS occultations and GCMs predictions}

The extinction profiles retrieved in the previous sections can be compared with results
obtained with other instruments and Global Circulation Models (GCM) predictions.
\cite{West2018} already confirmed the excellent agreement between the observations made during
two Voyager flybys and the position of the detached haze layer one Titan year later.
Comparisons with VIMS and CIRS instruments, also onboard Cassini, could be possible but
they are limited by the sensitivity of their detectors above 450 km where the detached haze is located.
Therefore, we only perform a comparison with two stellar occultations
made by the UVIS instrument in 2009 \citep{Koskinen2011}.
