\subsection{Dawn and dusk sides}

Aside from short time and local variations, we also are interested by images showing simultaneously the two sides
of Titan. At low phase angle, the viewing geometry allows us to retrieve the haze extinction with both the
illuminated and the dark side of Titan simultaneously  (Fig.~\ref{fig:dawn_dusk}).
In this case, we can compare the dawn and dusk part of the limb for
specific latitudes. The dawn side is the West side of Titan which is going out from the night and the
dusk side is the East side of Titan which is entering into the night. Although Titan's day is about 16 terrestrial
days, the time spent by the haze into the night or at the daylight is much shorter.
First, the atmosphere is superrotating and at altitude around 400 or 500 km the zonal wind is comparable to or
larger than the rotation speed of the ground \citep{Flasar2005, Achterberg2011, Lebonnois2012, Lellouch2019}.
This makes the actual diurnal cycle for the high altitude hazes shorter than 16 days by a factor of 2 or more.
The second point is that, at high altitude, the solid body of Titan masks the sun to the haze layer less than
half of the time. Thus, effects on the haze should be produced by process with timescale
comparable with a terrestrial day. Dynamics is the most obvious process to produce inhomogeneities.

The figure~\ref{fig:dawn_dusk}a presents the haze extinction at the dawn and dusk sides as observed
on June 2005 (Fig.~\ref{fig:dhl_2004_2008}c). The detached haze differs significantly between the two sides.
At the equator, we observe in the dawn side a double detached layer of 40 km thickness whereas it appears
as a thin layer of 10 km in the dusk side. The haze extinction at the peak differs significantly,
from 7$\times 10^{-8}$ to 2.5$\times 10^{-8}$ m$^{-1}$, respectively. The depletion below the haze layer
is also less pronounced in the dawn side compared to the dusk side. Although this observation was taken
during the period of stability for the detached haze, we observed a significant asymmetry between
the dawn and dusk side. This asymmetry is also observed in all the images taken at the same moment which were
analyzed in section 4.1.

Two years later, another low phase angle image was recorded (Fig.~\ref{fig:dawn_dusk}b).
This time, the detached haze layer is much more symmetrical between the two sides. The peaks of haze extinction
are at the same altitude with comparable values. However, small differences could be noticed: there is a
small secondary layer above the detached haze layer at the dusk side between \ang{50}S and \ang{20}N, and may be even
northward. In the northern hemisphere, the extinction appears slightly larger at dawn that at dusk, and the
vertical extent of the detached haze is also a bit larger. However, the overall morphologies are very similar.

At the equinox, the detached haze layer already started its drop in altitude (Fig.~\ref{fig:dawn_dusk}c).
There is significant differences between the two sides, in both hemispheres, while at the equator the two
profiles are almost identical. The haze layer is not exactly symmetrical in the southern hemisphere. The detached
haze itself is at the same altitude, but the depletion zone is at higher altitude at the dawn side, and the main
haze layer is thinner in the dusk side. In the northern hemisphere, the haze layer is more complex, and the
asymmetry is even more marked with a detached haze at different altitudes and with a different extinction. The
detached and main haze layers at the dawn side appears optically thicker than the layers at the dusk side.
This is consistent with the two previous cases.

After the equinox, a fewer number of images were taken at low phase angle. Among them, we do not notice any
significant differences between the dawn and dusk sides. After the reappearance of the detached haze layer in
2016, we found only one image with the relevant geometry to see both sides of Titan illuminated at the same time
(Fig.~\ref{fig:dawn_dusk}d). In this case, we are almost at the solstice and the sub-solar latitude is almost
at its maximal extent and does not allow us to probe the southern latitudes in the dark side of Titan.
However, the illuminated side spans all over the northern hemisphere that can
be observed twice on the bright side. The main haze appears very symmetrical in both sides and almost identical
above \ang{45}N. The depletion can be followed continuously all around the North Pole. At latitude lower than
\ang{45}N, the value of the haze extinctions are similar but the altitudes of the extinction peak differ by
25 km. We also observe partial secondary detached layers in each side, but not at the same latitudes.

The haze extinction and the altitude of detached haze layer can differ significantly between the dawn
and dusk sides. In general we notice a higher extinction in the dawn side than on the dusk side. This effect
could be due to a diurnal cycle.
