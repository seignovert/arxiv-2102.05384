@article{Cabane1993,
abstract = {It has been suggested that the haze aerosols in Titan's atmosphere might present an irregular structure, rather similar to the morphology of aggregates experimentally synthesized by Bar-Nun et al. (J. geophys. Res. 93, 8383, 1988). The theoretical approach of West (Appl. Opt. 30,5316, 1991) and West and Smith (Icarus 90, 330, 1991). which uses a fractal concept to numerically generate aggregates, allowed us to support this idea and to provide constraints on their size and shape by comparing the observed and modelled polarization properties of such particles. The building mechanism of these aerosols, when analysed using microphysical modelling (Cabane et al., Icarus 96, 176. 1992). leads naturally to aggregates. They are formed of spherical compact monomers, which build up in the region of photochemical synthesis, and whose radius depends mainly on the atmospheric pressure at the formation level. The subsequent growth of aggregates in the settling phase is treated here by introducing the fractal dimension as a parameter of the model (Df??? 2 in the case of cluster-cluster aggregation). Using this fractal model, a vertical distribution of size and number density of the aggregates is obtained down to ??? 80 km for different production altitudes. The previous estimate of the formation altitude of photochemical aerosols (??? 350-400 km) is confirmed when comparing the number of monomers per aggregate deduced from the present study with the value proposed by West and Smith. The vertical profile of the effective radius of aggregates is calculated as a function of the visible optical depth derived from Voyager imaging. A good fit with the radius derived from Voyager forward-scattering measurements is obtained (??? 0.3-0.5 ??m), still using a low formation altitude. Finally, it must be emphasized that, for the first time, observational and theoretical results about the size and the structure of particles are reconciled. ?? 1993.},

@article{Lora2015,
abstract = {Simulation results are presented from a new general circulation model (GCM) of Titan, the Titan Atmospheric Model (TAM), which couples the Flexible Modeling System (FMS) spectral dynamical core to a suite of external/sub-grid-scale physics. These include a new non-gray radiative transfer module that takes advantage of recent data from Cassini-Huygens, large-scale condensation and quasi-equilibrium moist convection schemes, a surface model with "bucket" hydrology, and boundary layer turbulent diffusion. The model produces a realistic temperature structure from the surface to the lower mesosphere, including a stratopause, as well as satisfactory superrotation. The latter is shown to depend on the dynamical core's ability to build up angular momentum from surface torques. Simulated latitudinal temperature contrasts are adequate, compared to observations, and polar temperature anomalies agree with observations. In the lower atmosphere, the insolation distribution is shown to strongly impact turbulent fluxes, and surface heating is maximum at mid-latitudes. Surface liquids are unstable at mid- and low-latitudes, and quickly migrate poleward. The simulated humidity profile and distribution of surface temperatures, compared to observations, corroborate the prevalence of dry conditions at low latitudes. Polar cloud activity is well represented, though the observed mid-latitude clouds remain somewhat puzzling, and some formation alternatives are suggested.},

abstract = {Titan, the main satellite of Saturn, has an active cycle of methane in its troposphere. Among other evidence for a mechanism of evaporation at work on the ground, dry lakebeds have been discovered. Recent Cassini infrared observations of these empty lakes have revealed a surface composition poor in water ice compared to that of the surrounding terrains—suggesting the existence of organic evaporites deposits. The chemical composition of these possible evaporites is unknown. In this paper, we study evaporite composition using a model that treats both organic solids dissolution and solvent evaporation. Our results suggest the possibility of large abundances of butane and acetylene in the lake evaporites. However, due to uncertainties of the employed theory, these determinations have to be confirmed by laboratory experiments.},

@article{Pollack1985,
abstract = {The Rosseland mean opacity was determined for an ensemble of dust grain species though to have been present in the early solar nebula, as well as in the primordial nebulae that helped to form the outer planets. In performing these calculations, we have derived and used more general equation for the Rosseland opacity that allows for anisotropic scattering. The identity of the major particle species and their relative abundances were found from thermodynamic equilibrium and solar elemental abundances. The optical constants of these materials were defined at wavelengths ranging from near-UV to the radio domain. Calculations were performed for a very wide range of particle size distributions, including a nominal one based on that of interstellar dust grains. In addition, asymptotic expressions for the Rosseland opacity are derived in the limits of very small and very large sized particles. Results are presented for nebular temperatures varying from 10 to 2500??K and for nebular gas densities varying from 10-14 to 1 g/cm3. The values of the Rosseland mean opacity do not depend sensitively on the choice of the particle size distribution function, provided that there are few particles having sizes in excess of several tens of microns. At low temperatures that lie within the stability field of condensed water ({\{}{\{}{\}}less-than or approximate{\{}{\}}{\}}200??K), this opacity varies approximately as the square of the temperature for the nominal size distribution and for all distributions having few particles larger than several tens of microns. However, the Rosseland opacity has a much weaker temperature dependence at higher temperatures for this class of size distributions and at all temperatures for size distributions containing numerous particles larger than several tens of microns. As a result, thermal convection in primordial nebulae occurs over broader ranges of altitudes at low temperatures and for size distributions for which extensive aggregation has not yet occurred. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {Noncoherent optical-imaging systems are identified as potential applications for the maximum-likelihood image-restoration methods that are currently being studied for various modalities of nuclear-medicine imaging. An analogy between the quantum-photon measurements of such an optical system and that of a gamma camera allow for this new application. Results of a computer simulation are presented that support its feasibility. One important property revealed by this simulation is that the maximum-likelihood method demonstrates the ability to extrapolate the Fourier spectrum of a band-limited signal. This ability can be partially understood in that this algorithm, similar to some of the other spectral-extrapolation algorithms, constrains the solution to nonnegative values. This observation has implications on the potential of superresolution, the restoration of images from a defocused optical system, and three-dimensional imaging with a microscope.},

We also show that the polar cloud system vanished progressively as Titan approached equinox in August 2009, revealing at optical wavelengths the underlying sea known as Kraken Mare. This decrease of activity suggests that the north-polar downwelling has begun to shut off. Such a scenario is compared with the Titan global circulation model of Rannou et al.

abstract = {The mineralogy and physical properties of Chelyabinsk meteorites (fall, February 15, 2013) are presented. Three types of meteorite material are present, described as the light-colored, dark-colored, and impact-melt lithologies. All are of LL5 composition with the impact-melt lithology being close to whole-rock melt and the dark-colored lithology being shock-darkened due to partial melting of iron metal and sulfides. This enables us to study the effect of increasing shock on material with identical composition and origin. Based on the magnetic susceptibility, the Chelyabinsk meteorites are richer in metallic iron as compared to other LL chondrites. The measured bulk and grain densities and the porosity closely resemble other LL chondrites. Shock darkening does not have a significant effect on the material physical properties, but causes a decrease of reflectance and decrease in silicate absorption bands in the reflectance spectra. This is similar to the space weathering effects observed on asteroids. However, compared to space-weathered materials, there is a negligible to minor slope change observed in impact-melt and shock-darkened meteorite spectra. Thus, it is possible that some dark asteroids with invisible silicate absorption bands may be composed of relatively fresh shock-darkened chondritic material. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Clouds on Titan result from the condensation of methane and ethane and, as on other planets, are primarily structured by circulation of the atmosphere. At present, cloud activity mainly occurs in the southern (summer) hemisphere, arising near the pole and at mid-latitudes from cumulus updrafts triggered by surface heating and/or local methane sources, and at the north (winter) pole, resulting from the subsidence and condensation of ethane-rich air into the colder troposphere. General circulation models predict that this distribution should change with the seasons on a 15-year timescale, and that clouds should develop under certain circumstances at temperate latitudes ( approximately 40 degrees ) in the winter hemisphere. The models, however, have hitherto been poorly constrained and their long-term predictions have not yet been observationally verified. Here we report that the global spatial cloud coverage on Titan is in general agreement with the models, confirming that cloud activity is mainly controlled by the global circulation. The non-detection of clouds at latitude approximately 40 degrees N and the persistence of the southern clouds while the southern summer is ending are, however, both contrary to predictions. This suggests that Titan's equator-to-pole thermal contrast is overestimated in the models and that its atmosphere responds to the seasonal forcing with a greater inertia than expected.},

We report on the photometric performance of the cameras including the use of polarization filters, point spread functions over a dynamic range greater than 10 7, gain and loss of hot pixels, changes in flat fields, and an analysis of charge transfer efficiency. Hot pixel behavior is more complicated than can be understood by a process of activation by cosmic ray damage and deactivation by annealing. Point spread function (PSF) analysis revealed a ghost feature associated with the narrow-angle camera Green filter. More generally, the observed PSFs do not fall off with distance as rapidly as expected if diffraction were the primary contributor. Stray light produces significant signal far from the center of the PSF. Our photometric analysis made use of calibrated spectra from eighteen stars and the spectral shape of the satellite Enceladus. The analysis revealed a shutter offset that differed from pre-launch calibration. It affects the shortest exposures. Star photometry results are reproducible to a few percent in most filters. No degradation in charge transfer efficiency has been detected although uncertainties are large.

abstract = {We present phase curves of Jupiter from 0-140 degrees as measured in multiple optical bandpasses by Cassini/ISS during the Millennium flyby of Jupiter in late 2000 to early 2001. Phase curves are of interest for studying the energy balance of Jupiter and understanding the scattering behavior of Jupiter as an exoplanet analog. We find that Jupiter is significantly darker at partial phases than an idealized Lambertian planet by roughly 25{\%} and is not well fit by Jupiter-like exoplanet atmospheric models across all wavelengths. We provide analytic fits to Jupiter's phase function in several Cassini/ISS imaging filter bandpasses. In addition, these observations show that Jupiter's color is more variable with phase angle than predicted by models. Therefore, the color of even a near Jupiter-twin planet observed at a partial phase cannot be assumed to be comparable to that of Jupiter at full phase. We discuss how WFIRST and other future direct-imaging missions can enhance the study of cool giants.},

The principal objective of the RADAR is to map the surface of Titan. This will be done in the imaging, scatterometer, and radiometer modes. The RADAR altimeter data will provide information on relative elevations in selected areas. Surfaces of the Saturn's icy satellites will be explored utilizing the RADAR radiometer and scatterometer modes. Saturn's atmosphere and rings will be probed in the radiometer mode only. The instrument is a joint development by JPL/NASA and ASI. The RADAR design features significant autonomy and data compression capabilities. It is expected that the instrument will detect surfaces with backscatter coefficient as low as −40 dB.},

abstract = {Titan's North Pole has been illuminated since the spring equinox in August 2009, allowing optical remote sensing instruments to acquire images of the lakes and seas that were discovered by the radar instrument earlier in the Cassini mission [1]. The illumination geometry continually improves with the incidence angle decreasing to its minimum at the summer solstice in 2017. Combined with highly inclined flybys that allow for small values of the emission angle, the 2013 observations are much less affected by the haze scattering because the optical path through the atmosphere is much shorter. The Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) can observe Titan's surface in seven infrared atmospheric windows between 0.96- and 5-$\mu$m. This study describes observations acquired during the recent T93 flyby on July 26, 2013. The footprint ranges from 10 km/pixel to 3 km/pixel. Maps of the three large seas (Ligeia Mare, Punga Mare, and Kraken Mare) at seven different wavelengths are being constructed and a mosaic of the lake area is being assembled. Ligeia Mare was previously imaged by the VIMS in June 2010 [2]. A preliminary analysis of the 2-$\mu$m map suggests that the shoreline has not evolved since 2010. The shape of the 2- $\mu$m atmospheric window will be compared between the two images and between the mare and the shore to investigate whether liquid ethane is present as is the case on Ontario lacus [3]. The lake area located between 0 and 90W was imaged with a resolution that allows comparison with the radar images. A preliminary comparison between the two data sets shows a very strong correlation. One part of Punga mare and a lake known as Kivu lacus were acquired on the same image. The northeastern part of Punga Mare seems entailed by a river network. No connections between Punga mare and Kivu lacus are observed on the VIMS image. Kivu lacus seems to lie in the center of a circular depression whose limit is bright at 2-$\mu$m. Equipotential maps are built from the topographic information obtained by the radar team [4] and the gravity potential determined by the Radio Science team [5]. As already determined [6], the topographic polar radius is smaller than the equipotential polar radius of an ellipsoid having the same volume. The three seas are indeed located in the depressions where the value of the gravitational potential is largest. On the other hand, the correlation is less clear with the lakes that seem to sit at higher elevation. If confirmed, this observation suggests that a putative subsurface connection between the lakes and the seas would drain out the lakes.

@article{Choukroun2012,
abstract = {Titan's shape is characterized by a difference between the long equatorial radius and the polar radius that is several hundred meters larger than that predicted by the flattening due to its spin rate. The North polar region is covered by large mare filled with hydrocarbons, including ethane. Moreover global circulation models predict ethane precipitation on the polar areas. This study shows that the shape of Titan can be explained by the subsidence associated with the substitution of methane with ethane-rich liquids percolating into the crust which, as suggested by evolution models, may be composed of methane clathrate hydrates. Such substitutions have been observed in laboratory experiments. This process would provide an additional methane source as required for sustaining the presence of this constituent in Titan's atmosphere through its history. A 270 m subsidence of the polar caps is explained by the circulation of 1.5 to 6 × 1018 kg of ethane in the top three kilometers of an initially methane-clathrate crust. This process would have operated during the last 300–1200 Myr at the present ethane production rate.},

abstract = {With its substantial atmosphere of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and nitriles, Saturn's moon Titan is a unique planetary satellite. Photochemical processing of the gaseous constituents produces an extended haze that obscures the surface. Soon after the Voyager fly-bys in 1980 and 1981 photochemical models led to the conclusion that there should be enough liquid methane/ethane/nitrogen to cover the surface to a depth of several hundred metres. Recent Earth-based radar echoes imply that surface liquid may be present at a significant fraction of the locations sampled. Here we present ground-based observations (at near-infrared wavelengths) and calculations showing that there is no evidence thus far for surface liquid. Combined with the specular signatures from radar observations, we infer mechanisms that produce very flat solid surfaces, involving a substance that was liquid in the past but is not in liquid form at the locations we studied.},

Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emission at the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators-advances in both formulation and numerical solution-are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two illconditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration.

A solid methane cloud with a nitrogen content of less than 14{\%} and a liquid methane-nitrogen cloud with a nitrogen content of ∼30{\%} form above ∼19 km and below ∼16 km altitude, respectively. Contrary to previous assertions, long-lived supercooled liquid methane-nitrogen droplets can be sustained in the region in between.

abstract = {We have analyzed high-latitude Voyager 1 infrared spectra of Titan to investigate emission features, above the noise level, which are unidentified to this date and are probably not due to gaseous components. These are mainly located near 220, 478, 504, 700, 760, and 816 cm−1, of which the 478 cm−1 feature has been previously identified as C4N2. Possible identifications of the five remaining features are investigated here by comparing the observations with laboratory spectra of potential ice condensate candidates: H2O, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H4, C3H8, C4H2, HCN, C2N2, HC3N, C4N2, CH3CN, as well as with spectra of some more complex nitriles and hydrocarbons, some of which correspond to original laboratory work. Radiative transfer calculations show that the feature observed near 220 cm−1, which could be water ice, is about a factor of 2 too narrow to be compatible with the whole signature of solid H2O. In this paper we have also performed radiative transfer calculations for solid C4N2 and HC3N (confirming the presence of the first and suggesting the latter). By comparing with laboratory data, we find that C2H2, C2H5CN, and possibly HCN and C2H6 solids, are likely candidates, while eliminating other condensed forms of photochemical products in Titan's stratosphere.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract Earth-based stellar occultations probe the temperature, pressure, and number-density profiles of planetary atmospheres in the microbar range with a vertical resolution of a few kilometers. Depending on the occultation data available for a given body and other information, the technique also allows determination of local density variations, extinction by aerosols and molecules, rotation period and zonal winds, atmospheric composition, and the temporal and spatial variability of an atmosphere. A brief quantitative description of the interaction of starlight with a planetary atmosphere is presented, and observational techniques are discussed. Observational results through 1995 are presented for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Titan, Neptune, Triton, Pluto, and Charon.},

@article{Schaller2006a,
abstract = {Nearly all adaptive optics images of Titan taken between December 2001 and November 2004 showed tropospheric clouds located within 30° of the south pole. We report here on a dissipation of Titan's south polar clouds observed in twenty-nine Keck and Gemini images taken between December 2004 and April 2005. The near complete lack of south polar cloud activity during this time, and subsequent resurgence months later at generally higher latitudes, may be the beginning of seasonal change in Titan's weather. The ∼5 month decrease in cloud activity may also have been caused by methane rainout from a large cloud event in October 2004. Understanding the seasonal evolution of Titan's clouds, and of any precipitation associated with them, is essential for interpreting the geological observations of fluid flow features observed over a wide range of Titan latitudes with the Cassini/Huygens spacecraft. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We also used results from an occultation observed by Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph in the ultraviolet. We found that particles responsible for the scattering in the detached haze have an effective radius around 0.15 {\$}\mu{\$}m and the aerosol size distribution follows a power law (exponent about –4.5). We discuss these results along with microphysical constraints and thermal equilibrium of the detached haze, and we conclude that only a strong interaction with atmospheric dynamics can explain such a structure.},

abstract = {We analyzed spectra acquired at the limb of Titan in the 2006-2013 period by the Cassini/Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) in order to monitor the seasonal evolution of the thermal, gas composition and aerosol spatial distributions. We are primarily interested here in the seasonal changes after the northern spring equinox and interpret our results in term of global circulation seasonal changes. Data cover the 600-1500cm-1 spectral range at a resolution of 0.5 or 15.5cm-1 and probe the 150-500km vertical range with a vertical resolution of about 30km. Retrievals of the limb spectra acquired at 15.5cm-1 resolution allowed us to derive eight global maps of temperature, aerosols and C2H2,C2H6 and HCN molecular mixing ratios between July 2009 and May 2013. In order to have a better understanding of the global changes taking place after the northern spring equinox, we analyzed 0.5cm-1 resolution limb spectra to infer the mixing ratio profiles of 10 molecules for some latitudes. These profiles are compared with CIRS observations performed during the northern winter. Our observations are compatible with the coexistence of two circulation cells upwelling at mid-latitudes and downwelling at both poles from at last January 2010 to at least June 2010. One year later, in June 2011, there are indications that the global circulation had reversed compared to the winter situation, with a single pole-to-pole cell upwelling at the north pole and downwelling at the south pole. Our observations show that in December 2011, this new pole-to-pole cell has settled with a downward velocity of 4.4mm/s at 450km above the south pole. Therefore, in about two years after the equinox, the global circulation observed during the northern winter has totally reversed, which is in agreement with the predictions of general circulation models. We observe a sudden unexpected temperature decrease above the south pole in February 2012, which is probably related to the strong enhancement of molecular gas in this region, acting as radiative coolers. In July and November 2012, we observe a detached haze layer located around 320-330km, which is comparable to the altitude of the detached haze layer observed by the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) in the UV.},

The basic method is a rational approximation, minimizing the relative error of the imaginary part on the real axis. It is complemented by other methods in order to increase efficiency and to overcome the inevitable failure of any rational approximation near the real axis. The procedures enable one to evaluate both real and imaginary parts of w(z) with high relative accuracy. The methods are simple, as demonstrated by a sample FORTRAN program.},

abstract = {Calculations of the optical properties of aggregate particles are able to resolve a persistent problem in understanding the shape and size of haze aerosols in the atmospheres of Titan and Jupiter. Most of the photometric and polarimetric observations for Titan can be explained by the presence of aggregate particles whose mean projected area is equal to that of a sphere with radius 0.14 ??m, containing monomers with mean radii near 0.06 ??m. An additional mode of smaller particles is needed to fit ultraviolet data. Aggregate particles can also account for the observed optical properties of Jupiter's high altitude haze. Knowledge of the size and shape of the particles will allow for more precise estimates of the sedimentation rates and provide a key constraint on the coupled surface/atmosphere evolution of Titan. ?? 1991.},

The Voyager 1 fly-by and occultation in 1980 provided the first radial survey of Titan's atmospheric pressure and temperature and evidence for the presence of strong zonal winds. It was realized that the motion of an atmospheric probe could be used to study the winds, which led to the inclusion of the Doppler Wind Experiment on the Huygens probe. Here we report a high resolution vertical profile of Titan's winds, with an estimated accuracy of better than 1 m s(-1). The zonal winds were prograde during most of the atmospheric descent, providing in situ confirmation of superrotation on Titan. A layer with surprisingly slow wind, where the velocity decreased to near zero, was detected at altitudes between 60 and 100 km. Generally weak winds (approximately 1 m s(-1)) were seen in the lowest 5 km of descent.},

We present remote sensing images of terrestrial analogues to the dunes on Titan obtained by Landsat and radar, both at considerably higher resolution than are available at Titan, that provide information about dune landforms and processes. Dunes are generally dark to radar, indicating smooth surfaces and signal absorbing materials, but at certain incidence angles, dune surfaces can reflect the radar signal and lead to a bright return. Linear dunes on Titan and Earth diverge around topographic obstacles, creating teardrop patterns that indicate mean direction of wind flow and sand transport. When sand supply or wind conditions change in linear dune fields, such as behind an obstacle or near the margin of the dune field, dunes disappear, change size and spacing, or change dune type. These comparisons of features on Titan and Earth provide a better understanding of the global, sand-transporting wind directions, sand properties and supply, and the nature of the underlying substrate, on Titan.},

abstract = {A 1x1 degree altitude map of Titan is constructed from the degree 4 gravity potential [1] and Titan's shape [2] determined by the Radio Science measurements and RADAR observations of the Cassini mission. The amplitude of the latitudinal altitude variations is equal to 300 m compared to 600 m for the amplitude of the latitudinal shape variations. The two polar caps form marked depressions with an abrupt change in topography at exactly 60 degrees at both caps. Three models are envisaged to explain the low altitude of the polar caps: (i) thinner ice crust due to higher heat flux at the poles, (ii) fossil shape acquired if Titan had higher spin rate in the past, and (iii) subsidence of the crust following the formation of a denser layer of clathrates as ethane rain reacts with the H2O ice crust [3]. The later model is favored because of the strong correlation between the location of the cloud system during the winter season and the latitude of the abrupt change in altitude. Low altitude polar caps would be the place where liquids would run to and eventually form large seas. Indeed, the large seas of Titan are found at the deepest locations at the North Pole. However, the lakes and terrains considered to be evaporite candidates due to their spectral characteristics in the infrared [4,5] seem to be perched. Lakes may have been filled during Titan's winter and then slowly evaporated leaving material on the surface. Interestingly, the largest evaporite deposits are located at the equator in a deep depression 150 m below the altitude of the northern seas. This observation seems to rule out the presence of a global subsurface hydrocarbon reservoir unless the evaporation rate at the equator is faster than the transport of fluids from the North Pole to the equator.

abstract = {The spherical harmonics discrete ordinate method for plane-parallel data assimilation (SHDOMPPDA) model is an unpolarized plane-parallel radiative transfer forward model, with corresponding tangent linear and adjoint models, suitable for use in assimilating cloudy sky visible and infrared radiances. It is derived from the spherical harmonics discrete ordinate method plane-parallel (SHDOMPP, also described in this article) version of the spherical harmonics discrete ordinate method (SHDOM) model for three-dimensional atmospheric radiative transfer. The inputs to the SHDOMPPDA forward model are profiles of pressure, temperature, water vapor, and mass mixing ratio and number concentration for a number of hydrometeor species. Hydrometeor optical properties, including detailed phase functions, are determined from lookup tables as a function of mass mean radius. The SHDOMPP and SHDOMPPDA algorithms and construction of the tangent-linear and adjoint models are described. The SHDOMPPDA forward model is validated against the Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer Model (DISORT) by comparing upwelling radiances in multiple directions from 100 cloud model columns at visible and midinfrared wavelengths. For this test in optically thick clouds the computational time for SHDOMPPDA is comparable to DISORT for visible reflection, and roughly 5 times faster for thermal emission. The tangent linear and adjoint models are validated by comparison to finite differencing of the forward model.},

@article{Achterberg2008,
abstract = {The Composite Infrared Radiometer-Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument, on the NASA Cassini Saturn orbiter, has been acquiring thermal emission spectra from the atmosphere of Titan since orbit insertion in 2004. Observation sequences for measuring stratospheric temperatures have been obtained using both a nadir mapping mode and a limb viewing mode. The limb observations give better vertical resolution, and give information from higher altitudes, while the nadir observations provide more complete longitude coverage. Because the scale height of Titan's atmosphere is large enough so that emission from a grazing ray is influenced by horizontal temperature variations in the atmosphere, we have developed a two-dimensional temperature retrieval algorithm for reducing the limb spectra, which solves simultaneously for meridional and vertical temperature variations. The analyzed nadir mapping data have sampled nearly all longitudes at latitudes from about 90?? S to 60?? N, providing temperatures between pressure levels of about 5 to 0.2 mbar. The limb data covers latitudes between about 75?? S and 85?? N, and yields temperatures between about 1 and 0.005 mbar, at a small number of longitudes. The retrieved temperatures are consistent with early results from nadir observations [Flasar, F.M., and 44 colleagues, 2005. Science 308, 975-978] between 0.5 and 5 mbar where both results are valid, with the warmest temperatures at the equator, and much stronger meridional temperature gradients in the northern (winter) hemisphere than in the southern. At higher altitudes not probed by nadir viewing, the limb data reveal that the stratopause is nearly 20 K warmer in the northern polar regions than at the equator and southern hemisphere, and that the altitude of the stratopause shifts from ???0.1 mbar (300 km) near the equator to 0.01 mbar (400 km) poleward of about 40?? N. When the gradient wind equation is used to construct a zonal mean wind, the reversal in sign of the temperature leads to capping of the winter westerly flow. The core of the resulting jet is about 190 m s-1 in magnitude, spans between 30?? N and 60?? N, and peaks near 0.1 mbar. Estimates of the radiative heating associated with the radiative disequilibrium lead to a meridional overturning timescale of about three Earth years. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cassini/VIMS T85 observations of a solar specular reflection off of Kivu Lacus (87.°4N 241.°1E) provide an empirical transmission spectrum of Titan's atmosphere. Because this observation was acquired from short range (33,000 km), its intensity makes it visible within the 2.0, 2.7, and 2.8 $\mu$m atmospheric windows in addition to the 5 $\mu$m window where all previous specular reflections have been seen. The resulting measurement of the total one-way normal atmospheric optical depth (corresponding to haze scattering plus haze and gas absorption) provides strong empirical constraints on radiative transfer models. Using those models, we find that the total haze column abundance in our observation is 20{\%} higher than the Huygens equatorial value. Ours is the first measurement in the 2-5 $\mu$m wavelength range that probes all the way to the surface in Titan's arctic, where the vast majority of surface liquids are located. The specular technique complements other probes of atmospheric properties such as solar occultations and the direct measurements from Huygens. In breaking the degeneracy between surface and atmospheric absorptions, our measured optical depths will help to drive future calculations of deconvolved surface albedo spectra. {\textcopyright} 2013.

Initial visible and radar imaging failed to find any evidence of an ocean, although abundant evidence was found that flowing liquids have existed on the surface. Here we provide definitive evidence for the presence of lakes on the surface of Titan, obtained during the Cassini Radar flyby of Titan on 22 July 2006 (T16). The radar imaging polewards of 70 degrees north shows more than 75 circular to irregular radar-dark patches, in a region where liquid methane and ethane are expected to be abundant and stable on the surface. The radar-dark patches are interpreted as lakes on the basis of their very low radar reflectivity and morphological similarities to lakes, including associated channels and location in topographic depressions. Some of the lakes do not completely fill the depressions in which they lie, and apparently dry depressions are present. We interpret this to indicate that lakes are present in a number of states, including partly dry and liquid-filled. These northern-hemisphere lakes constitute the strongest evidence yet that a condensable-liquid hydrological cycle is active in Titan's surface and atmosphere, in which the lakes are filled through rainfall and/or intersection with the subsurface 'liquid methane' table.},

It differs from room-temeprature laboratory spectra but it is consistent with some limited laboratory data at cold temperatures. Three new, weak methane bands were detected in the spectra of Uranus and Neptune. A strong absorption band in Jupiter's spectrum is possible due to water, confirming a strong depletion of oxygen in the probed part of Jupiter's atmosphere.},

abstract = {Ontario Lacus is thus far the largest flat-floored topographic$\backslash$ndepression of Titan's southern hemisphere interpreted as a permanent or$\backslash$nephemeral lake. From 2005 to 2010, it was imaged several times and at$\backslash$nvarious wavelengths by ISS, VIMS and RADAR instruments onboard Cassini's$\backslash$nspacecraft. We analyze the position and uncertainty of Ontario Lacus'$\backslash$nmargin in all these images using an edge detection method based on image$\backslash$nderivation. We find that, given the range of uncertainties in contour$\backslash$nlocations derived from images, no measurable displacement of Ontario$\backslash$nLacus' margin can be detected between 2005 and 2010 at the actual image$\backslash$nspatial resolutions. The discrepancy between this result and previous$\backslash$nones is attributable to differences in (1) the basics behind the methods$\backslash$nused, (2) the actual spatial resolutions and contrasts of the available$\backslash$nimages due to differential atmospheric scattering effects at different$\backslash$nwavelengths, and (3) the geomorphological interpretation of contours$\backslash$nderived from images acquired at different wavelengths. This lack of$\backslash$nmeasurable displacement in the images suggests that the imaged contour$\backslash$ncorresponds either (1) to the border of a surface liquid body, provided$\backslash$nthat potential changes in its extent over five terrestrial years were$\backslash$nnot sufficiently large to be measured, or (2) to the stationary$\backslash$ntopographic border between Ontario Lacus' depression and the surrounding$\backslash$nalluvial plain. Potential displacements of Ontario Lacus' margin between$\backslash$n2005 and 2010 are thus below the actual resolution of currently$\backslash$navailable images or have to be sought for within the extent of the$\backslash$ntopographic depression rather than along its borders.},

abstract = {Voyager 1 images of Titan, when normalized to remove limb darkening, reveal an axially symmetric brightness pattern with significant north-south asymmetry. This interhemispheric contrast seems to be a response to seasonal solar heating variations resulting from Titan's inclined spin axis. The contrast significantly lags the solar forcing, indicating that its production involves the atmosphere well below the unit optical depth level. The contrast has a significant effect on Titan's disk-integrated brightness as seen from earth, and probably accounts for most of the observed long term variation, with solar UV variations accounting for the remainder.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Saturn's largest moon Titan has a substantial nitrogen-methane atmosphere, with strong seasonal effects, including formation of winter polar vortices. Following Titan's 2009 northern spring equinox, peak solar heating moved to the northern hemisphere, initiating south-polar subsidence and winter polar vortex formation. Throughout 2010-2011, strengthening subsidence produced a mesospheric hot-spot and caused extreme enrichment of photochemically produced trace gases. However, in 2012 unexpected and rapid mesospheric cooling was observed. Here we show extreme trace gas enrichment within the polar vortex dramatically increases mesospheric long-wave radiative cooling efficiency, causing unusually cold temperatures 2-6 years post-equinox. The long time-frame to reach a stable vortex configuration results from the high infrared opacity of Titan's trace gases and the relatively long atmospheric radiative time constant. Winter polar hot-spots have been observed on other planets, but detection of post-equinox cooling is so far unique to Titan.},

This method avoids the$\backslash$nassumption that the atmospheric scale height is small compared with the$\backslash$nradius of the body, and it includes the variation of gravitational$\backslash$nacceleration with radius. First we derive the integral equations for$\backslash$ntemperature, scale height, pressure, number density, refractivity, and$\backslash$nradius in terms of the light-curve flux. These are then cast into$\backslash$nsummation form suitable for numerical evaluation. Equations for the$\backslash$nerrors in these quantities caused by Gaussian noise in the occultation$\backslash$nlight curve are also derived. The method allows for an arbitrary$\backslash$natmospheric boundary condition above the inversion region, and one$\backslash$nparticular boundary condition is implemented through least-squares$\backslash$nfitting. When the inversion equations are applied to noiseless test data$\backslash$nfor a simulated isothermal atmosphere, numerical errors in the$\backslash$ncalculated temperature profile are less than 5 parts in 10(4).$\backslash$nNonisothermal test cases are also presented. We explore the effects of$\backslash$n(1) the boundary condition, ( 2) data averaging ( in the time,$\backslash$nobserver-plane, and body-plane domains), ( 3) systematic errors in the$\backslash$nzero stellar flux level, and (4) light-curve noise on the accuracy of$\backslash$nthe inversion results. A criterion is presented for deciding whether$\backslash$ninversion would be an appropriate analysis for a given stellar$\backslash$noccultation light curve, and limitations to the radial resolution of the$\backslash$ninversion results are discussed. The inversion method is then employed$\backslash$non the light curves for the 1988 June 9 occultation by Pluto observed$\backslash$nwith the Kuiper Airborne Observatory and the 1997 November 4 occultation$\backslash$nby Triton observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Under the (possibly$\backslash$nincorrect) assumption that no extinction effects are present in the$\backslash$noccultation light curve, the Pluto inversion yields a 110 K isothermal$\backslash$npro. le down to approximately 1215 km radius, at which point a strong$\backslash$nthermal gradient, 3.9 +/- 0.6 K km(-1), abruptly appears, reaching 93 K$\backslash$nat the end of the inversion.

abstract = {The exploration of the Pluto-Charon system by the New Horizons spacecraft represents the first opportunity to understand the distribution of albedo and other photometric properties of the surfaces of objects in the Solar System's ???Third Zone??? of distant ice-rich bodies. Images of the entire illuminated surface of Pluto and Charon obtained by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) camera provide a global map of Pluto that reveals surface albedo variegations larger than any other Solar System world except for Saturn's moon Iapetus. Normal reflectances on Pluto range from 0.08???1.0, and the low-albedo areas of Pluto are darker than any region of Charon. Charon exhibits a much blander surface with normal reflectances ranging from 0.20???0.73. Pluto's albedo features are well-correlated with geologic features, although some exogenous low-albedo dust may be responsible for features seen to the west of the area informally named Tombaugh Regio. The albedo patterns of both Pluto and Charon are latitudinally organized, with the exception of Tombaugh Regio, with darker regions concentrated at the Pluto's equator and Charon's northern pole. The phase curve of Pluto is similar to that of Triton, the large moon of Neptune believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), while Charon's is similar to that of the Moon. Preliminary Bond albedos are 0.25????????0.03 for Charon and 0.72????????0.07 for Pluto. Maps of an approximation to the Bond albedo for both Pluto and Charon are presented for the first time. Our work shows a connection between very high albedo (near unity) and planetary activity, a result that suggests the KBO Eris may be currently active.},

Here we present the calibration and reduction of the polarization measurements and compare the polarization observations to models using fractal aggregate particles which have different sizes for the small dimension (monomer size) of which the aggregates are composed. We find that the Titan aerosols produce very large polarizations perpendicular to the scattering plane for scattering near 90?? scattering angle. The size of the monomers is tightly constrained by the measurements to a radius of 0.04 ?? 0.01 ??m at altitudes from 150 km to the surface. The decrease in polarization with decreasing altitude observed in red and blue light is as expected by increasing dilution due to multiple scattering at decreasing altitudes. There is no indication of particles that produce small amounts of linear polarization at low altitudes. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Venus' dense atmosphere and hostile conditions on its surface make space observation a challenging objective. That is why little is known about the geological processes on the Venusian surface and our understanding of Venusian tectonics and volcanism is limited. Recent thermal monitoring by the Venus Express mission indicates active volcanism, at very low resolution. Our knowledge cannot be improved with available instrumentation currently in Venusian orbit. To improve our knowledge of geological dynamics and surface activity, we propose a 5 year mission - VELOCITE ́ - to Venus. The mission is designed to determine the precise nature and activeness of surface tectonics and volcanism on and help us under- stand evolution of Earth like planets. The proposed mission concentrates on surface dynamics and will give a closer look also into the interior structures of the planet. The surface dynamics measurements will be achieved by utilising a high resolution In- SAR in combination with ground penetrating radar and gravity measurement system on the orbiting spacecraft (VISAGE) and a local scale in-situ measurement lander system (LOVE 1 {\&} 2).},

abstract = {Large expanses of linear dunes cover Titan's equatorial regions. As the Cassini mission continues, more dune fields are becoming unveiled and examined by the microwave radar in all its modes of operation (SAR, radiometry, scatterometry, altimetry) and with an increasing variety of observational geometries. In this paper, we report on Cassini's radar instrument observations of the dune fields mapped through May 2009 and present our key findings in terms of Titan's geology and climate. We estimate that dune fields cover ∼12.5{\%} of Titan's surface, which corresponds to an area of ∼10millionkm2, roughly the area of the United States. If dune sand-sized particles are mainly composed of solid organics as suggested by VIMS observations (Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) and atmospheric modeling and supported by radiometry data, dune fields are the largest known organic reservoir on Titan. Dune regions are, with the exception of the polar lakes and seas, the least reflective and most emissive features on this moon. Interestingly, we also find a latitudinal dependence in the dune field microwave properties: up to a latitude of ∼11°, dune fields tend to become less emissive and brighter as one moves northward. Above ∼11° this trend is reversed. The microwave signatures of the dune regions are thought to be primarily controlled by the interdune proportion (relative to that of the dune), roughness and degree of sand cover. In agreement with radiometry and scatterometry observations, SAR images suggest that the fraction of interdunes increases northward up to a latitude of ∼14°. In general, scattering from the subsurface (volume scattering and surface scattering from buried interfaces) makes interdunal regions brighter than the dunes. The observed latitudinal trend may therefore also be partially caused by a gradual thinning of the interdunal sand cover or surrounding sand sheets to the north, thus allowing wave penetration in the underlying substrate. Altimetry measurements over dunes have highlighted a region located in the Fensal dune field (∼5° latitude) where the icy bedrock of Titan is likely exposed within smooth interdune areas. The hemispherical assymetry of dune field properties may point to a general reduction in the availability of sediments and/or an increase in the ground humidity toward the north, which could be related to Titan's asymmetric seasonal polar insolation. Alternatively, it may indicate that either the wind pattern or the topography is less favorable for dune formation in Titan's northern tropics.},

abstract = {New measurements of the low-temperature near-infrared absorption of methane (Sihra, 1998, Laboratory measurements of near-infrared methane bands for remote sensing of the jovian atmosphere, Ph.D. thesis, University of Oxford) have been combined with existing, longer path-length, higher-temperature data of Strong et al. (1993, Spectral parameters of self- and hydrogen-broadened methane from 2000 to 9500 cm-1 for remote sounding of the atmosphere of Jupiter, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 50, 309-325) and fitted with band models. The combined data set is found to be more consistent with previous low-temperature methane absorption measurements than that of Strong et al. (1993, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 50, 309-325) but covers the same wider wavelength range and accounts for both self- and hydrogen-broadening conditions. These data have been fitted with k-coefficients in the manner described by Irwin et al. (1996, Calculated k-distribution coefficients for hydrogen- and self-broadened methane in the range 2000-9500 cm-1 from exponential sum fitting to band modelled spectra, J. Geophys. Res. 101, 26,137-26,154) and have been used in multiple-scattering radiative transfer models to assess their impact on our previous estimates of the jovian cloud structure obtained from Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) observations (Irwin et al., 1998, Cloud structure and atmospheric composition of Jupiter retrieved from Galileo NIMS real-time spectra, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 23,001-23,021; Irwin et al., 2001, The origin of belt/zone contrasts in the atmosphere of Jupiter and their correlation with 5-{\$}\mu{\$}m opacity, Icarus 149, 397-415; Irwin and Dyudina, 2002, The retrieval of cloud structure maps in the equatorial region of Jupiter using a principal component analysis of Galileo/NIMS data, Icarus 156, 52-63). Although significant differences in methane opacity are found at cooler temperatures, the difference in the optical depth of the atmosphere due to methane is found to diminish rapidly with increasing pressure and temperature and thus has negligible effect on the cloud structure inferred at deeper levels. Hence the main cloud opacity variation is still found to peak at around 1-2 bar using our previous analytical approach, and is thus still in disagreement with Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI) determinations (Banfield et al., 1998, Jupiter's cloud structure from Galileo imaging data, Icarus 135, 230-250; Simon-Miller et al., 2001, Color and the vertical structure in Jupiter's belts, zones and weather systems, Icarus 154, 459-474) which place the main cloud deck near 0.9 bar. Further analysis of our retrievals reveals that this discrepancy is probably due to the different assumptions of the two analyses. Our retrievals use a smooth vertically extended cloud profile while the SSI determinations assume a thin NH3 cloud below an extended haze. When the main opacity in our model is similarly assumed to be due to a thin cloud below an extended haze, we find the main level of cloud opacity variation to be near the 1 bar level-close to that determined by SSI and moderately close to the expected condensation level of ammonia ice of 0.85 bar, assuming that the abundance of ammonia on Jupiter is (7 ± 1) × 10-4 (Folkner et al., 1998, Ammonia abundance in Jupiter's atmosphere derived from the attenuation of the Galileo probe's radio signal, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 22,847-22,855; Atreya et al., 1999, A comparison of the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn: deep atmospheric composition, cloud structure, vertical mixing, and origin, Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1243-1262). However our data in the 1-2.5 {\$}\mu{\$}m range have good height discrimination and our lowest estimate of the cloud base pressure of 1 bar is still too great to be consistent with the most recent estimates of the ammonia abundance of 3.5 × solar. Furthermore the observed limited spatial distribution of ammonia ice absorption features on Jupiter suggests that pure ammonia ice is only present in regions of localised vigorous uplift (Baines et al., 2002, Fresh ammonia ice clouds in Jupiter: spectroscopic identification, spatial distribution, and dynamical implications, Icarus 159, 74-94) and is subsequently rapidly modified in some way which masks its pure absorption features. Hence we conclude that the main cloud deck on Jupiter is unlikely to be composed of pure ammonia ice and instead find that it must be composed of either NH4SH or some other unknown combination of ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulphide and exists at pressures of between 1 and 2 bar. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In 2006, during Cassini's 10th flyby of Titan (T10), Bellucci et al. (2009) observed a solar occultation by Titan's atmosphere through the solar port of the Cassini/VIMS instrument. These authors noticed the existence of an unexplained additional absorption superimposed to the CH4 3.3 µm band. Because they were unable to model this absorption with gases, they attributed this intriguing feature to the signature of solid state organic components. Kim et al. (2011) revisited the data collected by Bellucci et al. (2009) and they considered the possible contribution of aerosols formed by hydrocarbon ices. They specifically took into account C2H6, CH4, CH3CN, C5H12 and C6H12 ices. More recently, Maltagliati et al. (2015) analyzed a set of four VIMS solar occultations, corresponding to flybys performed between January 2006 and September 2011 at different latitudes. They confirmed the presence of the 3.3 µm absorption in all occultations and underlined the possible importance of gaseous ethane, which has a strong plateau of absorption lines in that wavelength range.In this work, we show that neither hydrocarbon ices nor molecular C2H6 cannot satisfactorily explain the observed absorption. Our simulations speak in favor of an absorption due to the presence of PAH molecules or HAC in the stratosphere of Titan. PAH have been already considered by Lopes-Puertas et al. (2013) at altitudes larger than ̃900 km and tentatively identified in the stratosphere by Maltagliati et al. (2015); PAH and HAC are good candidates for Titan's aerosols precursors.},

abstract = {Modern N2 ice glaciers flow from highlands to the east of the 750??????1400??km2 lowland of Sputnik Planum [SP] and merge with the ices of similar composition on SP. We explore the possibility that glaciation may be fed by N2 sublimation from SP followed by redeposition on the highlands. The uplands to the northeast, north, and west of SP have been erosionally sculpted into a variety of dissected terrains that feature linear depressions (valleys), locally in dendritic networks. We interpret these dissected terrains to have been carved by N2 glaciers formerly covering the uplands. Depositional glacial landforms (moraines, eskers, outwash) have not been identified, however. N2 glaciation would have a different erosional manifestation because the substrate (porous water ice and CH4-rich mantles) probably has lower density than N2, and also because of the lack of freeze-thaw weathering. If sufficiently thick (1???4??km), N2 glaciers might have experienced basal melting. Past flow of N2 glaciers from the highlands into SP may have detached and transported the prominent mountainous water ice mountains along the western border of SP.},

Each layer is characterized by a vertical location, an optical thickness, and an effective mean particle size, all of which vary with latitude. The tropospheric haze is optically thickest and extends to the greatest heights ({\~{}}40. mbar) over the equator; its top surface is at significantly greater depths ({\~{}}150. mbar) at mid-latitudes. The height of the haze correlates well with position of the tropopause as indicated by the temperature field.

This fact has caused astronomers who seek conditions suitable for life to search for exoplanets with-in the " habitable zone, " the narrow band in which liquid water can exist. However, can cell membranes be created and function at temperatures far below those at which water is a liquid? We take a step toward answering this question by proposing a new type of membrane, composed of small organic nitrogen compounds, that is capable of forming and functioning in liquid methane at cryogenic temperatures. Using molecular simulations, we dem-onstrate that these membranes in cryogenic solvent have an elasticity equal to that of lipid bilayers in water at room temperature. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrate that stable cryogenic membranes could arise from compounds observed in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon, Titan, known for the existence of seas of liquid meth-ane on its surface.},

abstract = {Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) has been observing Titan since April 2004, compiling a nearly global surface map and monitoring the surface and atmosphere for activity. Early images of the south-polar region revealed numerous dark surface features and contemporaneous convective cloud systems, suggesting the presence of hydrocarbon lakes similar to those later detected at Titan's North Pole. Intriguingly, repeated south-polar imaging by ISS revealed differences consistent with ponding of hydrocarbon liquids on the surface due to precipitation from a large storm. More recent ISS images of high northern latitudes illustrate the full extents ({\textgreater} 500,000 km(2)) of hydrocarbon seas, sections of which have been observed by Cassini's RADAR. These observations demonstrate dynamic processes at work on Titan and that the poles harbor liquid-hydrocarbon reservoirs, the extents of which differ from pole to pole and which may be coupled to seasonally varying circulation.

The method also allows calculation of the random-orientation scattering properties of a cluster in a fraction of the time required for numerical quadrature.

abstract = {We present results of an axisymmetric global circulation model of Titan with a simplified suite of atmospheric physics forced by seasonally varying insolation. The recent discovery of midlatitude tropospheric clouds on Titan has caused much excitement about the roles of surface sources of methane and the global circulation in forming clouds. Although localized surface sources, such as methane geysers or "cryovolcanoes," have been invoked to explain these clouds, we find in this work that clouds appear in regions of convergence by the mean meridional circulation and over the poles during solstices, where the solar forcing reaches its seasonal maximum. Other regions are inhibited from forming clouds because of dynamical transports of methane and strong subsidence. We find that for a variety of moist regimes, i.e., with the effect of methane thermodynamics included, the observed cloud features can be explained by the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere. Clouds at the solsticial pole are found to be a robust feature of Titan's dynamics, whereas isolated midlatitude clouds are present exclusively in a variety of moist dynamical regimes. In all cases, even without including methane thermodynamics, our model ceases to produce polar clouds approximately 4-6 terrestrial years after solstices.},

abstract = {A solar occultation by Titan's atmosphere has been observed through the solar port of the Cassini/VIMS instrument on January 15th, 2006. Transmission spectra acquired during solar egress probe the atmosphere in the altitude range 70 to 900 km at the latitude of 71° S. Several molecular absorption bands of CH4 and CO are visible in these data. A line-by-line radiative transfer calculation in spherical geometry is used to model three methane bands (1.7, 2.3, 3.3 $\mu$m) and the CO 4.7 $\mu$m band. Above 200 km, the methane 2.3 $\mu$m band is well fit with constant mixing ratio between 1.4 and 1.7{\%}, in agreement with in situ and other Cassini measurements. Under 200 km, there are discrepancies between models and observations that are yet fully understood. Under 480 km, the 3.3 $\mu$m CH4 band is mixed with a large and deep additional absorption. It corresponds to the C–H stretching mode of aliphatic hydrocarbon chains attached to large organic molecules. The CO 4.7 $\mu$m band is observed in the lower stratosphere (altitudes below 150 km) and is well fit with a model with constant mixing ratio of 33±10 ppm. The continuum level of the observed transmission spectra provides new constraints on the aerosol content of the atmosphere. A model using fractal aggregates and optical properties of tholins produced by Khare et al. [Khare, B.N., Sagan, C., Arakawa, E.T., Suits, F., Callcott, T.A., Williams, M.W., 1984. Icarus 60, 127–137] is developed. Fractal aggregates with more than 1000 spheres of radius 0.05 $\mu$m are needed to fit the data. Clear differences in the chemical composition are revealed between tholins and actual haze particles. Extinction and density profiles are also retrieved using an inversion of the continuum values. An exponential increase of the haze number density is observed under 420 km with a typical scale height of 60 km.},

abstract = {We have investigated the abundances of Titan's stratospheric oxygen compounds using 0.5 cm−1 resolution spectra from the Composite Infrared Spectrometer on the Cassini orbiter. The CO abundance was derived for several observations of far-infrared nadir spectra, taken at a range of latitudes (75° S–35° N) and emission angles (0°–60°), using rotational lines that have not been analysed before the arrival of Cassini at Saturn. The derived volume mixing ratios for the different observations are mutually consistent regardless of latitude. The weighted mean CO volume mixing ratio is 47±8 ppm if CO is assumed to be uniform with latitude. H2O could not be detected and an upper limit of 0.9 ppb was determined. CO2 abundances derived from mid-infrared nadir spectra show no significant latitudinal variations, with typical values of 16±2 ppb. Mid-infrared limb spectra at 55° S were used to constrain the vertical profile of CO2 for the first time. A vertical CO2 profile that is constant above the condensation level at a volume mixing ratio of 15 ppb reproduces the limb spectra very well below 200 km. This is consistent with the long chemical lifetime of CO2 in Titan's stratosphere. Above 200 km the CO2 volume mixing ratio is not well constrained and an increase with altitude cannot be ruled out there.},

Comparisons of the data with vertically homogeneous multiple-scattering models indicate that the single-scattering phase functions of the aerosols in both colors are rather flat at scattering angles between 80 and 150?? with a small peak at larger scattering (i.e., small phase) angles. The models indicate that the phase integral, q, for Titan in both red and blue light is about 1.66 ?? 0.1. Together with Younkin's value for the bolometric geometric albedo scaled to a radius of 2825 km, this implies an effective temperature in equilibrium with sunlight of 84 ?? 2??K, in agreement with recent thermal measurements. The single-scattering polarizations produced by the particles at 90?? scattering angle are quite large, {\textgreater}85{\%} in blue light and {\textgreater}95{\%} in red. A vertically homogeneous model in which the particles are assumed to scatter as spheres cannot simultaneously match the polarization observations in both colors for any refractive index. However, the observed polarizations are most sensitive to the particle properties near optical depth 1 2 in each color, and so models based on single scattering by spheres can be successful over a range of refractive indices if the size of the particles increases with depth and if the cross section of the particles increases sufficiently rapidly with decreasing wavelenght. For example, with nr = 1.70, the polarization (and the photometry) are reproduced reasonably well in both colors when the area-weighted average radous of the particles, ??, is given by ?? = (0.117 ??m)(??red/0.5)0.217. While this model does not reproduce the large increase in brightness from 129 to 160?? phase observed by Voyager 1, the observed increase is determined by the properties of the particles in the top few hundredths of an optical depth. Thus the addition of a very thin layer of forward-scattering aerosols on top of the above model offers one way of satisfying both the Pioneer 11 and Voyager 1 observations. Of course, other models, using bimodal size distributions or scattering by nonspherical particles, may also be capable of reproducing these data. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {The descent imager/spectral radiometer (DISR) instrument aboard the Huygens probe into the atmosphere of Titan measured the brightness of sunlight using a complement of spectrometers, photometers, and cameras that covered the spectral range from 350 to 1600 nm, looked both upward and downward, and made measurements at altitudes from 150 km to the surface. Measurements from the upward-looking visible and infrared spectrometers are described in Tomasko et al. [2008a. Measurements of methane absorption by the descent imager/spectral radiometer (DISR) during its descent through Titan's atmosphere. Planet. Space Sci., this volume]. Here, we very briefly review the measurements by the violet photometers, the downward-looking visible and infrared spectrometers, and the upward-looking solar aureole (SA) camera. Taken together, the DISR measurements constrain the vertical distribution and wavelength dependence of opacity, single-scattering albedo, and phase function of the aerosols in Titan's atmosphere. Comparison of the inferred aerosol properties with computations of scattering from fractal aggregate particles indicates the size and shape of the aerosols. We find that the aggregates require monomers of radius 0.05 ??m or smaller and that the number of monomers in the loose aggregates is roughly 3000 above 60 km. The single-scattering albedo of the aerosols above 140 km altitude is similar to that predicted for some tholins measured in laboratory experiments, although we find that the single-scattering albedo of the aerosols increases with depth into the atmosphere between 140 and 80 km altitude, possibly due to condensation of other gases on the haze particles. The number density of aerosols is about 5/cm3 at 80 km altitude, and decreases with a scale height of 65 km to higher altitudes. The aerosol opacity above 80 km varies as the wavelength to the -2.34 power between 350 and 1600 nm. Between 80 and 30 km the cumulative aerosol opacity increases linearly with increasing depth in the atmosphere. The total aerosol opacity in this altitude range varies as the wavelength to the -1.41 power. The single-scattering phase function of the aerosols in this region is also consistent with the fractal particles found above 60 km. In the lower 30 km of the atmosphere, the wavelength dependence of the aerosol opacity varies as the wavelength to the -0.97 power, much less than at higher altitudes. This suggests that the aerosols here grow to still larger sizes, possibly by incorporation of methane into the aerosols. Here the cumulative opacity also increases linearly with depth, but at some wavelengths the rate is slightly different than above 30 km altitude. For purely fractal particles in the lowest few km, the intensity looking upward opposite to the azimuth of the sun decreases with increasing zenith angle faster than the observations in red light if the single-scattering albedo is assumed constant with altitude at these low altitudes. This discrepancy can be decreased if the single-scattering albedo decreases with altitude in this region. A possible explanation is that the brightest aerosols near 30 km altitude contain significant amounts of methane, and that the decreasing albedo at lower altitudes may reflect the evaporation of some of the methane as the aerosols fall into dryer layers of the atmosphere. An alternative explanation is that there may be spherical particles in the bottom few kilometers of the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Atmospheric transport of chemical compounds and organic haze in the stratosphere of Titan is investigated with an axisymmetric general circulation model. It has been shown previously that the meridional circulation, dominated by global Hadley cells, is responsible both for the creation of an intense stratospheric zonal flow and for the accumulation of chemical compounds and haze in high latitudes. The modified composition in turn intensifies the meridional circulation and equator-to-pole thermal contrasts. This paper analyzes in detail the transport processes responsible for the observed vertical and latitudinal variations of atmospheric composition. It is shown that the competition between rapid sinking of air from the upper stratosphere in the winter polar vortex and latitudinal mixing by barotropic planetary waves (parameterized in the model) controls the vertical gradient of chemical compounds. The magnitude of polar enrichment (of a factor 1.4 to 20 depending on the particular species) with respect to low latitudes is mostly controlled by the way the meridional advection increases the concentrations of chemical compounds in the clean air which is rising from the troposphere, where most of the chemical compounds are removed by condensation ( the temperature at the tropopause being close to 70 K). The agreement between the observed and simulated contrasts provides an indirect but strong validation of the simulated dynamics, thus confirming the explanation put forward for atmospheric superrotation. It is shown also that by measuring the atmospheric composition, the Cassini-Huygens mission will provide a strong constraint about Titan's atmospheric circulation.},

abstract = {Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is the only Solar System planetary body other than Earth with a thick nitrogen atmosphere. The Voyager spacecraft confirmed that methane was the second-most abundant atmospheric constituent in Titan's atmosphere, and revealed a rich organic chemistry, but its cameras could not see through the thick organic haze. After a seven-year interplanetary journey on board the Cassini orbiter, the Huygens probe was released on 25 December 2004. It reached the upper layer of Titan's atmosphere on 14 January and landed softly after a parachute descent of almost 2.5 hours. Here we report an overview of the Huygens mission, which enabled studies of the atmosphere and surface, including in situ sampling of the organic chemistry, and revealed an Earth-like landscape. The probe descended over the boundary between a bright icy terrain eroded by fluvial activity—probably due to methane—and a darker area that looked like a river-or lake-bed. Post-landing images showed centimetre-sized surface details. Titan is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter's Ganymede, and is assumed to have formed in the Saturn subnebula about 4.5 billion years ago. One of its great mysteries is the origin of the methane in the atmosphere. With a lifetime of just 20 million years, methane must be regularly resupplied to the atmosphere to be as abundant as it is today. The surface of Titan remained hidden to the Voyager cameras, which led to speculation on its appearance and processes. The surface pressure on Titan is about 1.5 times that on Earth and the surface temperature is about minus 180 8C. At such a low temperature, it was postulated that liquid methane might be present on Titan's surface or in underground reservoirs. Although the images returned by the Voyager spacecraft were featureless, the richness of the detected organic compounds confirmed that Titan was indeed worthy of being revisited and explored in detail. The distinct orange appearance of Titan's atmosphere, as observed by the Voyagers in the early 1980s, comes from the methane-induced organic chemistry. Complex hydrocarbons and carbon-nitrogen-based compounds form high in the atmosphere, which is irradiated by solar ultraviolet rays and bombarded by energetic particles from Saturn's space environment. Methane converts to ethane, acetylene, ethylene, and so on, and when combined with nitrogen forms hydrogen cyanide and more complex nitrogen-bearing carbon and hydrocarbon compounds. These organic compounds float slowly downward in the atmosphere, condense in the stratosphere, and form the aerosols that give the well-known orange colour to Titan's hazy atmosphere. The aerosols eventually rain to the surface, where they accumulate. Images of Titan's surface at various resolutions were obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope 1,2 and ground-based observatories 3,4 .

abstract = {A new facet of image restoration research has begun to emerge in recent years: super-resolution of images, which we define as the processing of an image so as to recover object information from beyond the spatial frequency bandwidth of the optical system that formed the image. Simple Fourier analysis would indicate that superresolution is not possible. Therefore, it is important to reconcile this simplistic view with the existing algorithms that have been demonstrated to achieve super-resolution. In this article, we consider some of the algorithms that have demonstrated super-resolution and discuss the common principles that they share which makes it possible for them to recover some of the lost bandwidth of the object. We also consider the question of super-resolution performance, which is the measure of how much lost bandwidth can be recovered from a super-resolution algorithm, and how the performance is related to the algorithm principles that allow super-resolution to occur. We conclude with examples of super-resolution. (C) 1995 John Wiley {\{}{\&}{\}} Sons, Inc.},

After landing, it returned composition data of gases evaporated from the surface. Height profiles of molecular nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4) and molecular hydrogen (H2) were determined. Traces were detected on the surface of evaporating methane, ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), cyanogen (C2N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The methane data showed evidence that methane precipitation occurred recently. The methane mole fraction was (1.48+/-0.09) x 10(exp -2) in the lower stratosphere (139.8 km to 75.5 km) and (5.65+/-0.18) x 10(exp -2) near the surface (6.7 km to the surface). The molecular hydrogen mole fraction was (1.01+/-0.16) x 10(exp -3) in the atmosphere and (9.90+/-0.17) x 10(exp -4) on the surface. Isotope ratios were 167.7+/-0.6 for N-14/N-15 in molecular nitrogen, 91.1+/-1.4 for C-12/C-13 in methane and (1.35+/-0.30) x 10(exp -4) for D/H in molecular hydrogen. The mole fractions of Ar-36 and radiogenic Ar-40 are (2.1+/-0.8) x 10(exp -7) and (3.39 +/-0.12) x 10(exp -5) respectively.

abstract = {The new one-dimensional radiative–convective/photochemical/microphysical model described in Part I is applied to the study of Titan's atmospheric processes that lead to haze formation. Our model generates the haze structure from the gaseous species photochemistry. Model results are presented for the species vertical concentration profiles, haze formation and its radiative properties, vertical temperature/density profiles and geometric albedo. These are validated against Cassini/Huygens observations and other ground-based and space-borne measurements. The model reproduces well most of the latest measurements from the Cassini/Huygens instruments for the chemical composition of Titan's atmosphere and the vertical profiles of the observed species. For the haze production we have included pathways that are based on pure hydrocarbons, pure nitriles and hydrocarbon/nitrile copolymers. From these, the nitrile and copolymer pathways provide the stronger contribution, in agreement with the results from the ACP instrument, which support the incorporation of nitrogen in the pyrolized haze structures. Our haze model reveals a new second major peak in the vertical profile of haze production rate between 500 and 900km. This peak is produced by the copolymer family used and has important ramifications for the vertical atmospheric temperature profile and geometric albedo. In particular, the existence of this second peak determines the vertical profile of haze extinction. Our model results have been compared with the DISR retrieved haze extinction profiles and are found to be in very good agreement. We have also incorporated in our model heterogeneous chemistry on the haze particles that converts atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen. The resultant H2 profile is closer to the INMS measurements, while the vertical profile of the diacetylene formed is found to be closer to that of the CIRS profile when this heterogenous chemistry is included.},

The signature of atomic sodium NaI, known to be present above the clouds, is a powerful probe of the upper atmosphere, where it can be best detected and characterized at high spectral resolution. Our goal is to obtain a high-resolution transit spectrum of HD189733b in the region around the resonance doublet of NaI at 589 nm, to characterize the absorption signature previously detected from space at low resolution. We analyze archival transit data of HD189733b obtained with the HARPS spectrograph. We retrieve the transit spectrum and light curve of the planet, implementing corrections for telluric contamination and planetary orbital motion. We spectrally resolve the NaI D doublet and measure line contrasts of {\$}0.64\backslashpm0.07\backslash{\%}{\$} (D2) and {\$}0.40\backslashpm0.07\backslash{\%}{\$} (D1) and FWHMs of {\$}0.52\backslashpm0.08{\~{}}\backslashAA{\$}.

abstract = {Titan is an excellent test case for detailed studies of the scattering polarization from thick hazy atmospheres. We present the first limb polarization measurements of Titan, which are compared as a test to our limb polarization models. Previously unpublished imaging polarimetry from the HST archive is presented which resolves the disk of Titan. We determine flux-weighted averages of the limb polarization and radial limb polarization profiles, and investigate the degradation and cancelation effects in the polarization signal due to the limited spatial resolution of our observations. Taking this into account we derive corrected values for the limb polarization in Titan. The results are compared with limb polarization models, using atmosphere and haze scattering parameters from the literature. In the wavelength bands between 250 nm and 2000 nm a strong limb polarization of about 2-7 {\%} is detected with a position angle perpendicular to the limb. The fractional polarization is highest around 1 micron. As a first approximation, the polarization seems to be equally strong along the entire limb. The detected polarization is compatible with expectations from previous polarimetric observations taken with Voyager 2, Pioneer 11, and the Huygens probe. Our results indicate that ground-based monitoring measurements of the limb-polarization of Titan could be useful for investigating local haze properties and the impact of short-term and seasonal variations of the hazy atmosphere of Titan. Planets with hazy atmospheres similar to Titan are particularly good candidates for detection with the polarimetric mode of the upcoming planet finder instrument at the VLT. Therefore, a good knowledge of the polarization properties of Titan is also important for the search and investigation of extra-solar planets.},

abstract = {Water-ice-poor, 5-$\mu$m-bright material on Saturn's moon Titan has previously been geomorphologically identified as evaporitic. Here we present a global distribution of the occurrences of the 5-$\mu$m-bright spectral unit, identified with Cassini's Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and examined with RADAR when possible. We explore the possibility that each of these occurrences are evaporite deposits. The 5-$\mu$m-bright material covers 1{\%} of Titan's surface and is not limited to the poles (the only regions with extensive, long-lived surface liquid). We find the greatest areal concentration to be in the equatorial basins Tui Regio and Hotei Regio. Our interpretations, based on the correlation between 5-$\mu$m-bright material and lakebeds, imply that there was enough liquid present at some time to create the observed 5-$\mu$m-bright material. We address the climate implications surrounding a lack of evaporitic material at the south polar basins: if the south pole basins were filled at some point in the past, then where is the evaporite?},

abstract = {Linear sand dunes--dunes that extend parallel to each other rather than in star-like or crescentic forms--are the most abundant type of desert sand dune. But because their development and their internal structure are poorly understood, they are rarely recognized in the rock record. Models of linear dune development have not been able to take into account the sub-surface structure of existing dunes, but have relied instead either on the extrapolation of short-term measurements of winds and sediment transport or on observations of near-surface internal sedimentary structures. From such studies, it has not been clear if linear dunes can migrate laterally. Here we present images produced by ground penetrating radar showing the three-dimensional sedimentary structure of a linear dune in the Namib sand sea, where some of the world's largest linear dunes are situated. These profiles show clear evidence for lateral migration in a linear dune. Moreover, the migration of a sinuous crest-line along the dune produces divergent sets of cross-stratification, which can become stacked as the dune height increases, and large linear dunes can support superimposed dunes that produce stacked sets of trough cross-stratification. These clear structural signatures of linear dunes should facilitate their recognition in geological records.},

abstract = {At least four active geyser-like eruptions were discovered in Voyager 2 images of Triton, Neptune's large satellite. The two best documented eruptions occur as columns of dark material rising to an altitude of about 8 kilometers where dark clouds of material are left suspended to drift downwind over 100 kilometers. The radii of the rising columns appear to be in the range of several tens of meters to a kilometer. One model for the mechanism to drive the plumes involves heating of nitrogen ice in a subsurface greenhouse environment; nitrogen gas pressurized by the solar heating explosively vents to the surface carrying clouds of ice and dark partides into the atmosphere. A temperature increase of less than 4 kelvins above the ambient surface value of 38 +/- 3 kelvins is more than adequate to drive the plumes to an 8-kilometer altitude. The mass flux in the trailing clouds is estimated to consist of up to 10 kilograms of fine dark particles per second or twice as much nitrogen ice and perhaps several hundred or more kilograms of nitrogen gas per second. Each eruption may last a year or more, during which on the order of a tenth of a cubic kilometer of ice is sublimed.},

These spectra remain the only ones which have been obtained at maximum resolution over the entire NIMS wavelength range of 0.7-5.2 {\$}\mu{\$}m. The spectra cover the edge of a ``warm'' spot at location 5°N, 85°W. We have analyzed the spectra first with reflecting layer models and then with full multiple scattering models using the method of correlated-k. We find that there is strong evidence for three different cloud layers composed of a haze consistent with 0.5-{\$}\mu{\$}m radius tholins at 0.2 bar, a cloud of 0.75-{\$}\mu{\$}m NH3 particles at about 0.7 bar, and a two-component NH4SH cloud at about 1.4 bars with both 50.0- and 0.45-{\$}\mu{\$}m particles, the former being responsible for the main 5-{\$}\mu{\$}m cloud opacity. The NH3 relative humidity above the cloud tops is found to decrease slightly as the 5-{\$}\mu{\$}m brightness increases, with a mean value of approximately 14{\{}{\%}{\}}. We also find that the mean volume mixing ratio of ammonia above the middle (NH4SH) cloud deck is (1.7+/-0.1)×10-4 and shows a similar, though less discernible decrease with increasing 5-{\$}\mu{\$}m brightness. The deep volume mixing ratios of deuterated methane and phosphine are found to be constant and we estimate their mean values to be (4.9+/-0.2)×10-7 and (7.7+/-0.2)×10-7, respectively. The fractional scale height of phosphine above the 1 bar level is found to be 27.1+/-1.4{\{}{\%}{\}} and shows a slight decrease with increasing 5-{\$}\mu{\$}m brightness. The relative humidity of water vapor is found to be approximately 7{\{}{\%}{\}}, but while this and all the previous observations are consistent with the assumption that ``hot spots'' are regions of downwelling, desiccated air, we find that the water vapor relative humidity increases as the 5-{\$}\mu{\$}m brightness increases.},

abstract = {A matrix approach has been developed to compute bistatic scattering coefficients which include shadowing and multiple scattering effects for a randomly rough Kirchhoff surface. The method permits the computation of these coefficients in terms of the existing single-scatter bistatic scattering coefficients. Thus the effects of multiple scattering are readily recognized from the expressions obtained. The bistatic scattering coefficients are shown to satisfy energy conservation to at least two significant figures. It is observed that while polarized backscattering is dominated by the single-scattering process, the depolarized backscattering is due to multiple scattering. Unlike depolarization by slightly rough surfaces or volume scattering, the angular behavior of the depolarized backscattering is similar to that of the polarized backscattering. The transitional behavior of the relative dominance between single and multiple scattering for the polarized and depolarized scattering coefficient as a function of the azimuth angle is illustrated.},

abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-{\`{a}}-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

abstract = {We analyzed a unique, three-dimensional data set of Uranus acquired with the STIS Hubble spectrograph on August 19, 2002. The data covered a full afternoon hemisphere at 0.1 arc-sec spatial resolution between 300 and 1000 nm wavelength at 1 nm resolution. Navigation was accurate to 0.002 arc-sec and 0.02 nm. We tested our calibration with WFPC2 images of Uranus and found good agreement. We constrained the vertical aerosol structure with radiative transfer calculations. The standard types of models for Uranus with condensation cloud layers did not fit our data as well as models with an extended haze layer. The dark albedo of Uranus at near-infrared methane windows could be explained by methane absorption alone using conservatively scattering aerosols. Ultraviolet absorption from small aerosols in the stratosphere was strongest at high southern latitudes. The uppermost troposphere was almost clear, but showed a remarkable narrow spike of opacity centered on the equator to 0.2° accuracy. This feature may have been related to influx from ring material. At lower altitudes, the feature was centered at 1–2° latitude, suggesting an equatorial circulation toward the north. Below the 1.2 bar level, the aerosol opacity increased some 100 fold. A comparison of methane and hydrogen absorptions contradicted the standard interpretation of methane band images, which assumes that the methane mixing ratio is independent of latitude and attributes reflectivity variations to variations in the aerosol opacity. The opposite was true for the main contrast between brighter high latitudes and darker low latitudes, probing the 1–3 bar region. The methane mixing ratio varied between 0.014 and 0.032 from high to low southern latitudes, while the aerosol opacity varied only moderately with latitude, except for an enhancement at −45° latitude and a decrease north of the equator. The latitudinal variation of methane had a similar shape as that of ammonia probed by microwave observations at deeper levels. The variability of methane challenges our understanding of Uranus and requires reconsideration of previous investigations based on a faulty assumption. Below the 2 bar level, the haze was thinning somewhat. Our global radiative transfer models with 1° latitude sampling fit the observed reflectivities to 2{\{}{\%}{\}} rms. The observed spectra of two discrete clouds could be modeled by using the background model of the appropriate latitude and adding small amounts of additional opacity at levels near 1.2 bar (southern cloud) and levels as high as 0.1 bar (northern cloud). These clouds may have been methane condensation clouds of low optical depth (∼0.2).},

We use the large, spatially flat, and low-albedo interior of Ontario Lacus as a calibration target allowing us to derive an analytical atmospheric correction for emission angle. The dark lake interior is surrounded by two separate annuli that follow the lake interior's contours. The inner annulus is uniformly dark, but not so much as the interior lake, and is generally 5-10 kilometers wide at the lake's southeastern margin. We propose that it represents wet lakebed sediments exposed by either tidal sloshing of the lake or seasonal methane loss leading to lower lake-volume. The exterior annulus is bright and shows a spectrum consistent with a relatively low water-ice content relative to the rest of Titan. It may represent fine-grained condensate deposits from a past era of higher lake level. Together, the annuli seem to indicate that the lake level for Ontario Lacus has changed over time. This hypothesis can be tested with observations scheduled for future Titan flybys. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A set of lakes filled or partially filled with liquid hydrocarbon and empty lake basins have been discovered in the high latitudes of Saturns moon Titan1. These features were mapped by the radar instrument on the Cassini orbiter1, 2, 3, 4. Here we quantify the distribution of the lakes and basins, and show a pronounced hemispheric asymmetry in their occurrence. Whereas significant fractions of the northern high latitudes are covered by filled and empty lakes5, the same latitudes in the southern hemisphere are largely devoid of such features. We propose that in addition to known seasonal changes, the observed difference in lake distribution may be caused by an asymmetry in the seasons on Titan that results from the eccentricity of Saturns orbit around the Sun. We suggest that the consequent hemispheric difference in the balance between evaporation and precipitation could lead to an accumulation of lakes in one of Titans hemispheres. This effect would be modulated by, and reverse with, dynamical variations in the orbit. We propose that much like in the Earths glacial cycles, the resulting vigorous hydrologic cycle6 has a period of tens of thousands of years and leads to active geologic surface modification in the polar latitudes.},

abstract = {The Cassini Titan Radar Mapper obtained Synthetic Aperture Radar images of Titan's surface during four fly-bys during the mission's first year. These images show that Titan's surface is very complex geologically, showing evidence of major planetary geologic processes, including cryovolcanism. This paper discusses the variety of cryovolcanic features identified from SAR images, their possible origin, and their geologic context. The features which we identify as cryovolcanic in origin include a large (180 km diameter) volcanic construct (dome or shield), several extensive flows, and three calderas which appear to be the source of flows. The composition of the cryomagma on Titan is still unknown, but constraints on rheological properties can be estimated using flow thickness. Rheological properties of one flow were estimated and appear inconsistent with ammonia–water slurries, and possibly more consistent with ammonia–water–methanol slurries. The extent of cryovolcanism on Titan is still not known, as only a small fraction of the surface has been imaged at sufficient resolution. Energetic considerations suggest that cryovolcanism may have been a dominant process in the resurfacing of Titan.},

abstract = {A large cloud in the north polar region of Titan was first observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) in 2005 and then in 2006. This cloud, confined beyond the latitude 62°N, is surrounded by a mixture of aerosol and mist probably lying in the low stratosphere and troposphere. Subsequent images of this region of Titan show a gradual vanishing of this cloud which was reported previously. In this paper, we characterize the physical properties of this cloud, haze, and mist as well as their time evolutions. We note several details on the images such as a secondary cloud above the main cloud and latitudes beyond 70°N. We also show that the cloud disappearance leaves the polar region poorly loaded in aerosols, yielding an annular zone of aerosols between 50°N and 65°N. Our analysis suggests that this structure observed by VIMS in the near-IR is an annular structure observed by ISS on board Voyager one Titan year ago in 1980.},

Titan's shape approximates a hydrostatic, synchronously rotating triaxial ellipsoid but is best fit by such a body orbiting closer to Saturn than Titan presently does. Titan's lack of high relief implies that most--but not all--of the surface features observed with the Cassini imaging subsystem and synthetic aperture radar are uncorrelated with topography and elevation. Titan's depressed polar radii suggest that a constant geopotential hydrocarbon table could explain the confinement of the hydrocarbon lakes to high latitudes.},

abstract = {By comparing observations from the Cassini imaging system, UV spectrometer, and Huygens atmospheric structure instrument, we determine an apparent radius of ∼40 nm, an imaginary index {\{}{\textless}{\}}0.3 at 187.5 nm and a number density of ∼30 particles cm-3 for the detached haze layer at 520 km in Titan's mesosphere. We point out that the detached haze layer is coincident with a local maximum in the measured temperature profile and show that the temperature maximum is caused by absorption of sunlight in the detached haze layer. This rules out condensation as the source of the layer. The derived particle size is in good agreement with that estimated for the size of the monomers in the aggregate particles that make up the main haze layer. Calculations of the sedimentation velocity of the haze particles coupled with the derived number density imply a mass flux 2.7 - 4.6 × 10- 14 g cm- 2 s- 1, which is approximately equal to the mass flux required to explain the main haze layer. Because the aerosol size and mass flux derived for the detached layer agree with those determined for the main layer, we suggest that the main haze layer in Titan's stratosphere is formed primarily by sedimentation and coagulation of particles in the detached layer. This implies that high-energy radical and ion chemistry in the thermosphere is the main source of haze on Titan. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study of Titan properties with remote sensing relies on a good knowledge of the atmosphere properties. The in-situ observations made by Huygens combined with recent advances in the definition of methane properties enable to model and interpret observations with a very good accuracy. Thanks to these progresses, we can analyze in this work the observations made at the limb of Titan in order to retrieve information on the haze properties as its vertical profiles but also the spectral behaviour between 0.88 and 5.2 µm. To study the haze layer and more generally the source of opacities in the stratosphere, we use some observation made at the limb of Titan by the VIMS instrument onboard Cassini. We used a model in spherical geometry and in single scattering, and we accounted for the multiple scattering with a parallel plane model that evaluate the multiple scattering source function at the plane of the limb. Our scope is to retrieve informations about the vertical distribution of the haze, its spectral properties, but also to obtain details about the shape of the methane windows to desantangle the role of the methane and of the aerosols. We started our study at the latitude of 55°N, with a image taken in 2006 with a relatively high spatial resolution (for VIMS). Our preliminary results shows the spectral properties of the aerosols are the same whatever the altitude. This is a consequence of the large scale mixing. From limb profile between 0.9 and 5.2 µm, we can probe the haze layer from about 500 km (at 0.9 µm) to the ground (at 5.2 µm). We find that the vertical profile of the haze layer shows three distinct scale heights with transitions around 250 km and 350 km. We also clearly a transition around 70-90 km that may be due to the top of a condensation layer.},

abstract = {Titan is the only satellite in our Solar System with a dense atmosphere. The surface pressure is 1.5 bar (ref. 1) and, similar to the Earth, N2 is the main component of the atmosphere. Methane is the second most important component, but it is photodissociated on a timescale of 10(7) years (ref. 3). This short timescale has led to the suggestion that Titan may possess a surface or subsurface reservoir of hydrocarbons to replenish the atmosphere. Here we report near-infrared images of Titan obtained on 26 October 2004 by the Cassini spacecraft. The images show that a widespread methane ocean does not exist; subtle albedo variations instead suggest topographical variations, as would be expected for a more solid (perhaps icy) surface. We also find a circular structure approximately 30 km in diameter that does not resemble any features seen on other icy satellites. We propose that the structure is a dome formed by upwelling icy plumes that release methane into Titan's atmosphere.},

abstract = {We utilized aerosol extinction coefficient inferred from Cassini/CIRS spectra in the far and mid infrared region to derive the extinction cross-section near an altitude of 190km at 15??S (from far-IR) and 20??S (from mid-IR). By comparing the extinction cross section that are derived from observations with theoretical calculations for a fractal aggregate of 3000 monomers, each having a radius of 0.05??m, and a fractal dimension of 2, we are able to constrain the refractive index of Titan's aerosol between 70 and 1500cm -1 (143 and 6.7??m). As the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index are related by the Kramers-Kronig equation, we apply an iterative process to determine the optical constants in the thermal infrared. The resulting spectral dependence of the imaginary index displays several spectral signatures, some of which are also seen for some Titan's aerosol analogues (tholins) produced in laboratory experiments. We find that Titan's aerosols are less absorbent than tholins in the thermal infrared. The most prominent emission bands observed in the mid-infrared are due to CH bending vibrations in methyl and methylene groups. It appears that Titan's aerosols predominantly display vibrations implying carbon and hydrogen atoms and perhaps marginally nitrogen. In the mid infrared, all the aerosol spectral signatures are observed at three additional latitudes (56??S, 5??N and 30??N) and in the 193-274km altitude range, which implies that Titan's aerosols exhibit the same chemical composition in all investigated latitude and altitude regions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In 2006, during Cassini's 10th flyby of Titan (T10), Bellucci et al. (2009) observed a solar occultation by Titan's atmosphere through the solar port of the Cassini/VIMS instrument. These authors noticed the existence of an unexplained additional absorption superimposed to the CH4 3.3 microns band. Because they were unable to model this absorption with gases, they attributed this intriguing feature to the signature of solid state organic components. Kim et al. (2011) revisited the data collected by Bellucci et al. (2009) and they considered the possible contribution of aerosols formed by hydrocarbon ices. They specifically took into account C2H6, CH4, CH3CN, C5H12 and C6H12 ices. More recently, Maltagliati et al. (2015) analyzed a set of four VIMS solar occultations, corresponding to flybys performed between January 2006 and September 2011 at different latitudes. They confirmed the presence of the 3.3 µm absorption in all occultations and underlined the possible importance of gaseous ethane, which has a strong plateau of absorption lines in that wavelength range. In this work, we show that neither hydrocarbon ices nor molecular C2H6 cannot satisfactorily explain the observed absorption. Our simulations speak in favor of an absorption due to the presence of PAH molecules or HAC in the stratosphere of Titan. PAH have been already considered by Lopes-Puertas et al. (2013) at altitudes larger than {\~{}}900 km and tentatively identified in the stratosphere by Maltagliati et al. (2015); PAH and HAC are good candidates for Titan's aerosols precursors.},

abstract = {Intermediate resolution (6??) photoelectric spectral scans of Titan, Saturn, Saturn's Rings and the Moon appear in two forms: ratio spectra of Titan vs the Rings and of Saturn vs the Rings, and relative reflectivities, which are compared to previously published results. Titan's geometrical albedo of 0.094 ?? 0.012 was measured at 4255?? with a 50?? bandpass. From this and the spectral measurements, we derived the geometrical albedo as a function of wavelength. We find that the wavelength dependences of Titan's uv spectrum and the spectrum of Saturn's Rings are remarkably similar. No trace of any absorption bands is apparent. These results imply that uv gaseous absorption and Rayleigh scattering play a strongly subdued role in Titan's atmosphere. Any homogeneous atmospheric model implies that the absorber responsible for Titan's uv spectral albedo varies strongly with wavelength. On the other hand, we find that the uv observations can be satisfied by an absorber having a relatively weak dependence upon wavelength if an inhomogeneous atmospheric model is employed. In particular, a fine dust, which absorbs as 1/??, can explain the uv observations provided that it is preferentially distributed high up in Titan's atmosphere where the optical depth from Rayleigh scattering is low. The likely presence of such a dust in Jupiter's atmosphere and the difficulty in explaining the nature of a continuous uv absorber which varies rapidly with wavelength suggest that the gas and aerosol in Titan's atmosphere are inhomogeneously distributed. ?? 1973.},

abstract = {The conditions of formation and the form of yardangs in ignimbrites in the Central Andes of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina may be the most convincing terrestrial analog to the processes and lithology that produce the extensive yardangs of the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) of Mars. Through remote and field study of yardang morphologies in the Central Andes we highlight the role that variable material properties of the host lithology plays in their final form. Here, ignimbrites typically show two main facies: an indurated and jointed facies, and a weakly to poorly indurated, ash- and pumice-rich facies. Both facies are vertically arranged in large (erupted volume {\textgreater}100's of km3) ignimbrites resulting in a resistant capping layer, while smaller (10's of km3) ignimbrites are made predominantly of the weakly indurated facies. The two facies have quite different mechanical properties; the indurated facies behaves as strong rock, fails by block collapse and supports steep/vertical cliffs, while the non-indurated facies is more easily eroded and forms gentle slopes and manifests as more subdued erosional forms. In response to aeolian action, the presence of an upper indurated facies results in large, elongate, high aspect ratio (1:20–1:40) megayardangs that form tall (100m), thin ridges with steep to vertical walls. These are built on a broad apron of the weakly indurated facies with abundant fallen blocks from the upper indurated facies. These terrestrial megayardangs appear to be analogous to megayardangs with associated block fields seen on Mars. Smaller-volume, weakly indurated ignimbrites are sculpted into smaller, stubbier forms with aspect ratios of 1:5–1:10 and heights rarely exceeding 10m. Excavation of a windward basal moat suggests an erosional progression like that seen in incipient yardangs on Mars. Excavation rates of 0.007–0.003cm/year are calculated for the weakly indurated ignimbrites. While a persistent strong unidirectional wind is the dominant parameter controlling yardang formation and orientation, a role for flow separation and vorticity is also suggested by our observations at both yardang types. While the indurated facies is commonly pervasively jointed, jointing is of secondary importance in controlling yardang orientation. Serrated margins, a common feature on Mars, result from oblique intersections of jointing with yardang flanks or scarps of ignimbrite. The processes of yardang formation we describe from ignimbrites from the Central Andes are not necessarily specific to ignimbrites, but do connote that degree and distribution of induration is a major control in yardang formation and this has implications for the lithology of the MFF on Mars.},

abstract = {The irreversible conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons in Titan's stratosphere implies a surface or subsurface methane reservoir. Recent measurements from the cameras aboard the Cassini orbiter fail to see a global reservoir, but the methane and smog in Titan's atmosphere impedes the search for hydrocarbons on the surface. Here we report spectra and high-resolution images obtained by the Huygens Probe Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer instrument in Titan's atmosphere. Although these images do not show liquid hydrocarbon pools on the surface, they do reveal the traces of once flowing liquid. Surprisingly like Earth, the brighter highland regions show complex systems draining into flat, dark lowlands. Images taken after landing are of a dry riverbed. The infrared reflectance spectrum measured for the surface is unlike any other in the Solar System; there is a red slope in the optical range that is consistent with an organic material such as tholins, and absorption from water ice is seen. However, a blue slope in the near-infrared suggests another, unknown constituent. The number density of haze particles increases by a factor of just a few from an altitude of 150 km to the surface, with no clear space below the tropopause. The methane relative humidity near the surface is 50 per cent.},

abstract = {Investigating the overall brightness of planets (and moons) provides insight into their envelopes and energy budgets [1, 2, 3, 4]. Titan phase curves (a representation of overall brightness vs. Sun-object-observer phase angle) have been published over a limited range of phase angles and spectral passbands [5, 6]. Such information has been key to the study of the stratification, microphysics and aggregate nature of Titan's atmospheric haze [7, 8], and has complemented the spatially-resolved observations first showing that the haze scatters efficiently in the forward direction [7, 9]. Here we present Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem whole-disk brightness measurements of Titan from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. The observations reveal that Titan's twilight (loosely defined as the view when the phase angle 150deg) outshines its daylight at various wavelengths. From the match between measurements and models, we show that at even larger phase angles the back-illuminated moon will appear much brighter than when fully illuminated. This behavior is unique to Titan in our solar system, and is caused by its extended atmosphere and the efficient forward scattering of sunlight by its atmospheric haze. We infer a solar energy deposition rate (for a solar constant of 14.9 Wm-2) of (2.84+/-0.11)x10{\^{}}14 W, consistent to within 1-2 standard deviations with Titan's time-varying thermal emission spanning 2007- 2013 [10, 11]. We propose that a forward scattering signature may also occur at large phase angles in the brightness of exoplanets with extended hazy atmospheres, and that this signature has valuable diagnostic potential for atmospheric characterization.},

abstract = {Yardangs, an exclusive landform due to intensive wind erosion, cover a large area in the hyper-arid Lut desert of Iran. This paper presents a new approach using Self Organizing Map (SOM) as unsupervised algorithm of artificial neural networks for analysis and characterization of yardangs. Nowadays, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) with 3 arc sec data (approximately 90 m resolution) and nearly world wide coverage provides uniform good quality data. The SRTM 3 arc sec data were re-projected to a 90 m UTM grid. Bivariate quadratic surfaces with moving window size of 5×5 were fitted to this DEM. The first derivative, slope steepness and the second derivatives minimum, maximum curvature and cross-sectional curvatures were calculated as geomorphometric parameters used as input to the SOMs. 42 SOMs with different learning parameter settings, e.g. initial and final radius, number of iterations, and the effect of random initial weights on average quantization error were investigated. A SOM with a low average quantization error (0.1040) was used for further analysis. Feature space analysis, morphometric signatures, three-dimensional inspection, auxiliary data like Landsat ETM+ and high resolution satellite imagery from QuickBird facilitated the assignment of semantic meaning to the output classes in terms of geomorphometric features. Results are provided in a geographic information system as thematic maps of landform entities based on form and slope, e.g. yardangs (ridge), corridors (valley) or planar areas. The results showed that all yardangs and corridors were clearly recognized and classified by this method when their width was larger than the DEM resolution but became unrecognizable if their width is much smaller than the grid resolution. The identified yardangs and corridors are aligned NNW–SSE parallel to the prevailing direction of the strong local 120 days wind and cover about 31{\%} and 42{\%} of the study area respectively. The results demonstrate that SOM is a very efficient tool for analyzing aeolian landforms in hyper-arid environments that provides very useful information for terrain feature analysis in remote regions.},

abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanetary systems is a powerful technique that can reveal Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits, can enable detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres, and is a key step towards imaging Earth-like planets. Imaging detections are challenging due to the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter-clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our Solar System.},

abstract = {We modeled the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) response of linear dunes of the Great Sand Sea in Egypt using a single surface scattering term, based on Integral Equation and Physical Optics Models. Using multi-frequency SIR-C/X-SAR radar scenes and topography obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), we were able to estimate reasonable values for the parameters describing the surface roughness of the dunes. As the linear dunes of the Great Sand Sea are relevant analogs for the linear dunes observed on Titan by the Cassini Radar instrument, these results were thus used as a starting point to simulate the radar response of Titan's dunes, as imaged by the Radar instrument onboard the Cassini spacecraft during the T8 flyby in October 2005. We show that a single surface scattering term is not sufficient to simulate the radar signal backscattered by the dunes on Titan: one has to add a diffuse scattering term, indicating that Titan's dunes are likely to have somewhat inhomogeneous internal structures related to porosity and/or internal layering. Our results also indicate that the dunes on Titan should be close to perfectly smooth, possibly because of the formation of smaller ripples than on Earth, plus smoothing resulting from precipitation events.},

abstract = {We present results from a new three dimensional GCM with a complete microphysics treatment of the aerosols. We used the Titan Community Atmospheres Model (CAM), to which we have coupled the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA). This model was unable to reproduce superrotating winds without an ad hoc forcing of the zonal winds. Our model was validated by comparing the extinction, optical depth, phase functions, and number densities with data from Cassini and Huygens, as well as other space based and ground based observations. These comparisons allowed us to constrain the microphysical properties of Titan's haze in the tropics at the time of the Huygens descent. Our best fit of the free aerosol parameters include a haze production rate of 1×10-14gcm-2s-1 and a charge to radius ratio on the particles of 7.5e-/$\mu$m. Despite recent evidence of equatorial precipitation on Titan, we find the aerosols are only slowly removed by rainfall, less than once in 50 Earth years. One way to fit the wavelength dependence of the optical depth is to model the haze as fractal particles with a changing fractal dimension of 2 above 80km that increases to 2.8 below 30km. We investigate the spatial and seasonal variability of Titan's haze in our model. We find that the haze particle size and number density responds to the dynamics and creates a seasonal cycle in Titan's albedo.},

abstract = {The study of Titan properties with remote sensing relies on a good knowledge of the atmosphere properties. The in-situ observations made by Huygens combined with recent advances in the definition of methane properties enable to model and interpret observations with a very good accuracy. Thanks to these progresses, we can analyze in this work the observations made at the limb of Titan in order to retrieve information on the haze properties as its vertical profiles and its spectral behaviour along the VIMS/Cassini range (from 0.88 to 5.1 $\mu$m). However, for applications to real atmospheres, one need to account for the widening of the spectroscopic lines (e.g., Voigt profile) and apply an empirical cut-off of the far wings. In general, this is a multiplying function of the wavenumber, f($\nu$), applied to the Voigt profile that allows a faster decay of the wing profile beyond a given distance from the center of the line $\nu$0 : f($\nu$)=1 if |$\nu$- $\nu$0| ≤ $\Delta$$\nu$, and f($\nu$)=exp(-|$\nu$- $\nu$0|/ $\sigma$) if |$\nu$- $\nu$0| 〉 $\Delta$$\nu$. Although the 2-$\mu$m window is apparently straitforward to model, it appears that the standard cut-off parameters (that is $\Delta$$\nu$ {\~{}} 26 cm-1 and $\sigma$ {\~{}} 120 cm-1) which is used for other windows in Titan's atmosphere is not adequat for this window. Other sets of parameter must be used to reproduce Titan spectrum at 2 $\mu$m. However, there is no convergence of the results between these works and a large variety of cut-off parameters are used. Alternatively, it was found that some gas absorptions (ethane and another unknown gas) leave a signature around 2-$\mu$m and also affect the transparency in this window. In our study we make an exhaustive investigation on the cut-off parameters to determine which are the best couples of parameters to fit the 2-$\mu$m window. We also evaluated how gaseous absorptions can allow to reach a satisfactory agreement and, especially, if it allows to match observations with the standard cut-off. Finally, we investigate the impact of the different solutions (different cut-off, with or without supplementary absorptions) on the retrieved surface albedo.},

The maps were made from images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope's planetary camera (295 km per pixel) through atmospheric windows at 940 and 1080 nm. Coverage at all longitudes and between 45°S and 60°N was obtained with 14 orbits from 4-18 October 1994. Each image is characterized by haze with both limb effects (brightening) and a large north-south contrast. Subtracting an averaged image from each frame removes haze effects and reveals surface features of ∼10{\%} maximum contrast. Many features are clearly visible in multiple images and in both filters, but the surface map is dominated by a large, bright, roughly rectangular feature centered at 110°W, 10°S and elongated in an east-west direction (4000 × 2500 km2): this feature and others indicate the diversity of Titan's surface. We consider the origin of the bright feature in an otherwise dark landscape and suggest that highland washing by methane rainfall is a likely mechanism.},

abstract = {In this work we consider the problem of determination of the stratospheric density and temperature profiles from the refractive-angle measurements. This study introduces new geophysical products, which can be obtained from the GOMOS instrument located on board the Envisat satellite. The procedure of temperature reconstruction consists of the following steps. First, the refractivity is reconstructed from the refractive angle measurements using the inversion of Abel-type integral. Refractivity is connected with air density via the Edlen formula. The pressure profile is calculated then using the hydrostatic equation. Finally, the temperature profile is determined from density and pressure data using the state equation of an ideal gas. The realistic error and analysis was performed. Sensitivity of the inversion procedure to the main error sources is studied. It is shown that both the sampling frequency and instrumental noise are very important for the reconstruction while the influence of scintillation effect and chromatic smoothing are negligible. The first results of density and temperature retrieval from the GOMOS measurements are presented.},

abstract = {We have developed a coupled general circulation model of Titan's atmosphere in which the aerosol haze is treated with a microphysical model and is advected by the winds. The radiative transfer accounts for the non uniform haze distribution and, in turn, drives the dynamics. We analyze the GCM results, especially focusing on the difference between a uniform haze layer and a haze layer coupled to the dynamics. In the coupled simulation the aerosols tend to accumulate at the poles, at latitudes higher than ±60°. During winter, aerosols strongly radiate at thermal infrared wavelengths enhancing the cooling rate near the pole. Since this tends to increase the latitudinal gradients of temperature the direct effect of this cooling excess, in contrast to the uncoupled haze case, is to increase the strength of the meridional cells as well as the strength of the zonal winds and profile. This is a positive feedback of the haze on dynamics. The coupled model reproduces observations about the state of the atmosphere better than the uniform haze model, and in addition, the northern polar hood and the detached haze are qualitatively reproduced.},

abstract = {Chondrites are the most primitive meteorites. However,they were all modified in some way by asteroidal geological processes operating over 4.5 Gyr. Hence, to decipher the formation and origins of their components, we must first understand how chondritic materials were modified in their asteroidal parent bodies.The modifications induced by secondary processes should not be underestimated and have to be precisely estimated before any interpretation of chondrite properties in terms of cosmochemistry.Raman spectroscopy enables the determination of the degree of structural order of the polyaromatic organic matter present in the matrix of chondrites. This structural order directly reflects the thermal history of the host meteorites in their parent bodies. Raman spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to the lowest petrologic types (3.03.2). The transformation of aromatic carbonaceous matter towards graphite is irreversible, and independent of the mineralogy and degree of aqueous alteration: it is mainly controlled by the peak metamorphic temperature. Moreover, under the assumption of fairly similar organic precursors, the degree of organization of polyaromatic organic matter allows for a direct comparison of the metamorphic grade of objects from different chondritic groups. It is then possible to evaluate the metamorphic grade of the objectsand to assign a petrologic type along a unique petrologic scale [14].This technique has been successfully applied to type 3 Unequilibrated Ordinary Chondrites [1], carbonaceous CV [2] and CO [3] chondrites. Both falls and finds, from Antarctica [4] and elsewhere, have been analyzed.The present NASA collection of Antarctic meteorites represents an incredible source of precious samples for our community. The objective of the present work is to finely characterize the thermal history of most of the type 3 chondrites from that collection. (i)Reliable petrologic types will be assessed; (ii)the most primitive type 3 chondrites (petrologic type ≤3.1) will be identified; and (iii)potential samples having experienced a slightly different thermal history will be pointed out. The Meteorite Working Group of the Johnson Space Center is generously currently allocating us with more than 150 chondrites (Unequilibrated Ordinary Chondrites, carbonaceous CV and CO chondrites). Out of 60 chondrites received so far, the thermal histories of 40 samples have already been characterized. Real discrepancies with the preliminary JSC petrologic type attribution were already found. Characterization of the thermal history of type 3 chondrites based on the structural order of the polyaromatic carbonaceous material is a reliable, nondestructive, and relatively easy to apply method. We encourage museums to routinely use it before the samples being accessible to the community.},

abstract = {Titan's middle atmosphere is currently experiencing a rapid change of season after northern spring arrived in 2009 (refs 1, 2). A large cloud was observed for the first time above Titan's southern pole in May 2012, at an altitude of 300 kilometres. A temperature maximum was previously observed there, and condensation was not expected for any of Titan's atmospheric gases. Here we report that this cloud is composed of micrometre-sized particles of frozen hydrogen cyanide (HCN ice). The presence of HCN particles at this altitude, together with temperature determinations from mid-infrared observations, indicate a dramatic cooling of Titan's atmosphere inside the winter polar vortex in early 2012. Such cooling is in contrast to previously measured high-altitude warming in the polar vortex, and temperatures are a hundred degrees colder than predicted by circulation models. These results show that post-equinox cooling at the winter pole of Titan is much more efficient than previously thought.},

abstract = {Titan's atmosphere is optically thick and hides the surface and the lower layers from the view at almost all wavelengths. However, because gaseous absorptions are spectrally selective, some narrow spectral intervals are relatively transparent and allow to probe the surface. To use these intervals (called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once gas spectroscopic linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows depends on the way the far wings of the methane absorption lines are cut-off. We know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained with the same cut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 $\mu$m. This discrepancy is generally treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off description for this specific window. This window is relatively transparent and surface may have specific spectral signatures that could be detected. Thus, a good knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope is to better understand what causes the difference between the 2 $\mu$m window and the other windows. In this work, we used scattered light at the limb and transmissions in occultation observed with VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) onboard Cassini, around the 2 $\mu$m window. Data shows an absorption feature that participates to the shape of this window. Our atmospheric model fits well the VIMS data at 2 $\mu$m with the same cut-off than for the other windows, provided an additional absorption is introduced in the middle of the window around {\~{}}2.065 $\mu$m. It explains well the discrepancy between the cut-off used at 2 $\mu$m, and we show that a gas with a fairly constant mixing ratio, possibly ethane, may be the cause of this absorption. Finally, we studied the impact of this absorption on the retrieval of the surface reflectivity and found that it is significant.},

abstract = {We use a stochastic approach in order to investigate the production and evolution of aerosols in Titan's atmosphere. The simulation initiates from the benzene molecules observed in the thermosphere and follows their evolution to larger aromatic structures through reaction with gas-phase radical species. Aromatics are allowed to collide and provide the first primary particles, which further grow to aggregates through coagulation. We also consider for the first time the contribution of heterogenous processes at the surface of the particles, which are described by the deposition of the formed aromatic structures on the surface of the particles, and also through the chemical reaction with radical species. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of aerosols in terms of size, shape, and density is a result of competing processes between surface growth, coagulation, and sedimentation. Furthermore, our simulations clearly demonstrate the presence of a spherical growth region in the upper atmosphere followed by a transition to an aggregate growth region below. The transition altitude ranges between 500 and 600 km based on the parameters of the simulation.},

abstract = {Images of Titan acquired over five nights in October 2004 using the adaptive optics system at the Keck Observatory show dramatic increases in tropospheric cloud activity at the south pole compared with all other images of Titan clouds to date. During this time, Titan's south polar clouds brightened to more than 18 times their typical values. The Cassini Ta flyby of Titan occurred as this storm was rapidly dissipating. We find that the brightness of this cloud outburst is consistent with the dramatic transient brightening of Titan observed in atmospheric windows on two nights in 1995 by Griffith et al. [Griffith, C.A., Owen, T., Miller, G.A., Geballe, T., 1998. Nature 395 (6702) 575-578] if we scale the brightness of the cloud by projecting it onto the equator. While apparently infrequent, the fact that large cloud events have been observed in different seasons of Titan's year indicates that these large storms might be a year-round phenomenon on Titan. We propose possible mechanisms to explain these occasional short-term increases in Titan's cloud activity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We estimate how the light curve and total stellar heating of a planet depend on forward and backward scattering in the clouds based on Pioneer and Cassini spacecraft images of Jupiter and Saturn. We fit analytical functions to the local reflected brightnesses of Jupiter and Saturn depending on the planet's phase. These observations cover broad bands at 0.59-0.72 and 0.39-0.5 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m, and narrow bands at 0.938 (atmospheric window), 0.889 (CH4 absorption band), and 0.24-0.28 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m. We simulate the images of the planets with a ray-tracing model, and disk-integrate them to produce the full-orbit light curves. For Jupiter, we also fit the modeled light curves to the observed full-disk brightness. We derive spherical albedos for Jupiter, Saturn, and for planets with Lambertian and Rayleigh-scattering atmospheres. Jupiter-like atmospheres can produce light curves that are a factor of two fainter at half-phase than the Lambertian planet, given the same geometric albedo at transit. The spherical albedo is typically lower than for a Lambertian planet by up to a factor of 1.5. The Lambertian assumption will underestimate the absorption of the stellar light and the equilibrium temperature of the planetary atmosphere. We also compare our light curves with the light curves of solid bodies: the moons Enceladus and Callisto. Their strong backscattering peak within a few degrees of opposition (secondary eclipse) can lead to an even stronger underestimate of the stellar heating.},

The experimental data have been fitted to a functional representation, describing the 1/4 like behaviour of the Rayleigh scattering cross section over a wide wavelength range. The resulting values are compared with numerical predictions, based on refractive indices and molecular anisotropy data available in the literature. From this, values of molecular volume polarizability vol and depolarization ratios are derived. It is found that the optical extinction for all three gases is governed by Rayleigh scattering for wavelengths down to 200 nm. No absorption onsets in the specified deep-UV region have been observed.},

We use a retrieval scheme originally developed for absolute stellar accelerometry [Connes, P., 1985. Astrophys.

The method allows to measure the Doppler shift induced at a given point by the zonal wind flow, with high precision. The short-wavelength channel (4200-5200 {\AA}) probes one scale height higher than the long-wavelength one (5200-6200 {\AA}), and we observe statistically significant evidence for stronger winds at higher altitudes. The results show a high dispersion. Globally, we detect prograde zonal winds, with lower limits of 62 and 50 ms-1 at the regions centered at 200 and 170 km altitude, but approximately a quarter of the measurements indicates null or retrograde winds. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We have developed a Web-based program for quickly estimating the regional environmental consequences of a comet or asteroid impact on Earth (www.lpl.arizona.edu/ impacteffects). This paper details the observations, assumptions and equations upon which the program is based. It describes our approach to quantifying the principal impact processes that might affect the people, buildings, and landscape in the vicinity of an impact event and discusses the uncertainty in our predictions. The program requires six inputs: impactor diameter, impactor density, impact velocity before atmospheric entry, impact angle, the distance from the impact at which the environmental effects are to be calculated, and the target type (sedimentary rock, crystalline rock, or a water layer above rock). The program includes novel algorithms for estimating the fate of the impactor during atmospheric traverse, the thermal radiation emitted by the impact-generated vapor plume (fireball), and the intensity of seismic shaking. The program also approximates various dimensions of the impact crater and ejecta deposit, as well as estimating the severity of the air blast in both crater-forming and airburst impacts. We illustrate the utility of our program by examining the predicted environmental consequences across the United States of hypothetical impact scenarios occurring in Los Angeles. We find that the most wide-reaching environmental consequence is seismic shaking: both ejecta deposit thickness and air-blast pressure decay much more rapidly with distance than with seismic ground motion. Close to the impact site the most devastating effect is from thermal radiation; however, the curvature of the Earth implies that distant localities are shielded from direct thermal radiation because the fireball is below the horizon.},

abstract = {Optically thin cirrus near the tropical tropopause regulate the humidity of air entering the stratosphere, which in turn has a strong influence on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. Recent high-altitude, unmanned aircraft measurements provide evidence for two distinct classes of cirrus formed in the tropical tropopause region: (i) vertically extensive cirrus with low ice number concentrations, low extinctions, and large supersaturations (up to ∼70{\{}{\%}{\}}) with respect to ice; and (ii) vertically thin cirrus layers with much higher ice concentrations that effectively deplete the vapor in excess of saturation. The persistent supersaturation in the former class of cirrus is consistent with the long time-scales (several hours or longer) for quenching of vapor in excess of saturation given the low ice concentrations and cold tropical tropopause temperatures. The low-concentration clouds are likely formed on a background population of insoluble particles with concentrations less than 100 L(-1) (often less than 20 L(-1)), whereas the high ice concentration layers (with concentrations up to 10,000 L(-1)) can only be produced by homogeneous freezing of an abundant population of aqueous aerosols. These measurements, along with past high-altitude aircraft measurements, indicate that the low-concentration cirrus occur frequently in the tropical tropopause region, whereas the high-concentration cirrus occur infrequently. The predominance of the low-concentration clouds means cirrus near the tropical tropopause may typically allow entry of air into the stratosphere with as much as ∼1.7 times the ice saturation mixing ratio.},

In the course of our work, we have found variations, such as as seasonal and diurnal effects, as well as temporary features in the southern polar region. The north-south asymmetry is shown to have changed since 2000 in the near-IR and to be currently organized in a brighter northern than southern pole. We study this evolution here. With our data, we also have new significant statistical evidence of diurnal effects in Titan's stratosphere, with a brighter (as much as 19{\%}) morning limb appearing in our images in many cases, when the phase effect is expected on the evening side. The southern bright feature is probably a time-limited seasonal and/or meteorological phenomenon, revolving around the south pole (confined in its motion within the 80◦S parallel) and located somewhere in the upper troposphere (18–40 km of altitude). Its behavior and possible nature are discussed here.},

Clouds affect every aspect of a planetary atmosphere, from the transport of radiation, to atmospheric chemistry, to dynamics and they influence - if not control - aspects such as surface temperature and habitability. In this review we aim to provide an introduction to the role and properties of clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres. We consider the role clouds play in influencing the spectra of planets as well as their habitability and detectability. We briefly summarize how clouds are treated in terrestrial climate models and consider the far simpler approaches that have been taken so far to model exoplanet clouds, the evidence for which we also review. Since clouds play a major role in the atmospheres of certain classes of brown dwarfs we briefly discuss brown dwarf cloud modeling as well. We also review how the scattering and extinction efficiencies of cloud particles may be approximated in certain limiting cases of small and large particles in order to facilitate physical understanding. Since clouds play such important roles in planetary atmospheres, cloud modeling may well prove to be the limiting factor in our ability to interpret future observations of extrasolar planets.},

abstract = {Ontario Lacus is the largest lake of the whole southern hemisphere of Titan, Saturn's major moon. It has been imaged twice by each of the Cassini imaging systems (Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) in 2004 and 2005, Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) in 2007 and 2009 and RADAR in 2009 and 2010). We compile a geomorphological map and derive a "hydrogeological" interpretation of Ontario Lacus, based on a joint analysis of ISS, VIMS and RADAR SAR datasets, along with the T49 altimetric profile acquired in December 2008. The morphologies observed on Ontario Lacus are compared to landforms of a semi-arid terrestrial analog, which resembles Titan's lakes: the Etosha Pan, located in the Owambo Basin (Namibia). The Etosha Pan is a flat-floored depression formed by dissolution, under semi-arid conditions, of a surface evaporitic layer (calcretes) controlled by groundwater vertical motions. We infer that Ontario Lacus is an extremely flat and shallow depression lying in an alluvial plain surrounded by small mountain ranges under climatic conditions similar to those of terrestrial semi-arid regions. Channels are seen in the southern part of Ontario Lacus in VIMS and RADAR data, acquired at a 2-years time interval. Their constancy in location with time implies that the southern portion of the depression is probably not fully covered by a liquid layer at the time of the observations, and that they most probably run on the floor of the depression. A shallow layer of surface liquids, corresponding to the darkest portions of the RADAR images, would thus cover about 53{\%} of the surface area of the depression, of which almost 70{\%} is located in its northern part. These liquid-covered parts of the depression, where liquid ethane was previously identified, are interpreted as topographic lows where the "alkanofer" raises above the depression floor. The rest of the depression, and mostly its southern part, is interpreted as a flat and smooth exposed floor, likely composed of a thick and liquid-saturated coating of photon-absorbing materials in the infrared. This hypothesis could explain its dark appearance both in the infrared and radar data and the persistence of channels seen on the depression floor over the time. Shorelines are observed on the border of Ontario Lacus suggesting past high-stand levels of the alkanofer table. The analogy with the Etosha Pan suggests that Ontario Lacus' depression developed at the expense of a soluble layer covering the region. Dissolution of this layer would be controlled by vertical motions of the alkanofer table over the time. During flooding events, liquid hydrocarbons covering the depression floor would dissolve the surface layer, increasing progressively the diameter of the depression on geological timescales. During drought episodes, liquid hydrocarbons of the underground alkanofer would evaporate, leading to crystallization of "evaporites" in the pores and at the surface of the substratum, and to the formation of the regional soluble layer. The presence of specific landforms (lunette dunes or evaporites) is compatible with such evaporitic regional settings. Alternatively, but not exclusively, the surface soluble layer might have formed by accumulation on the ground of soluble compounds formed in the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Stellar occultations observed by the Cassini/UVIS instrument provide unique data that probe the mesosphere and lower thermosphere of Titan at altitudes between 400 and 1400km. This region is a site of complex photochemistry that forms hydrocarbon and nitrile species, and plays a crucial role in the formation of the organic hazes observed in the stratosphere, but has yet to be adequately characterized. We analyzed publicly available data obtained between flybys Tb in December 2004 and T58 in July 2009, with an emphasis on two stable occultations obtained during flybys T41 and T53. We derived detailed density profiles for CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C4H2, HCN, HC3N and C6H6 between ∼400 and 1200km and extinction coefficients for aerosols between 400 and 900km. Our analysis reveals the presence of extinction layers in the occultation data that are associated with large perturbations in the density profiles of the gaseous species and extinction profiles of the aerosols. These relatively stable features vary in appearance with location and change slowly over time. In particular, we identify a sharp extinction layer between 450 and 550km that coincides with the detached haze layer.

abstract = {The study of Titan properties with remote sensing relies on a good knowledge of the atmosphere properties. The in-situ observations made by Huygens combined with recent advances in the definition of methane properties enable to model and interpret observations with a very good accuracy. Thanks to these progresses, we can analyze in this work the observations made at the limb of Titan in order to retrieve information on the haze properties as its vertical profiles but also the spectral behaviour between 0.88 and 5.2 $\mu$m.To study the haze layer and more generally the source of opacities in the stratosphere, we use som observation made at the limbe of Titan by the VIMS instrument onboard Cassini. We used a model in spherical geometry and in single scattering, and we accounted for the multiple scattering with a parallel plane model that evaluate the multiple scattering source function at the plane of the limb.Our scope is to retrieve informations about the vertical distribution of the haze, its spectral properties, but also to obtain details about the shape of the methane windows to disantangle the role of the methane and of the aerosols.We started our study at the latitude of 55°N, with a image taken in 2006 with a relatively high spatial resolution (for VIMS). Our preliminary results shows the spectral properties of the aerosols are the same whatever the altitude. This is a consequence of the large scale mixing. From limb profile between 0.9 and 5.2 $\mu$m, we can probe the haze layer from about 500 km (at 0.9 $\mu$m) to the ground (at 5.2 $\mu$m). We find that the vertical profile of the haze layer shows three distinct scale heights with transitions around 250 km and 350 km. We also clearly a transition around 70-90 km that may be due to the top of a condensation layer.},

abstract = {UV observations with Cassini ISS Narrow Angle Camera of Titan's detached haze is an excellent tool to probe its aerosols content without being affected by the gas or the multiple scattering. Unfortunately, its low extent in altitude requires a high resolution calibration and limits the number of images available in the Cassini dataset. However, we show that it is possible to extract on each profile the local maximum of intensity of this layer and confirm its stability at 500 ± 8 km during the 2005-2007 period for all latitudes lower than 45°N. Using the fractal aggregate scattering model of Tomasko et al. (2008) and a single scattering radiative transfer model, it is possible to derive the optical properties required to explain the observations made at different phase angles. Our results indicates that the aerosols have at least ten monomers of 60 nm radius, while the typical tangential column number density is about 2 {\textperiodcentered} 1010 agg.m−2. Moreover, we demonstrate that these properties are constant within the error bars in the southern hemisphere of Titan over the observed time period. In the northern hemisphere, the size of the aerosols tend to decrease relatively to the southern hemisphere and are associated with a higher tangential opacity. However, the lower number of observations available in this region due to the orbital constraints is a limiting factor in the accuracy of these results. Assuming a fixed homogeneous content we notice that the tangential opacity can fluctuate up to a factor 3 among the observations at the equator. These variations could be linked with short scale temporal and/or longitudinal events changing the local density of the layer.},

abstract = {Understanding the unusual radar scattering characteristics of sand dunes is necessary in the analysis of radar images of aeolian landscapes of the earth and of other planets. In this paper we report on airborne radar scatterometer data of sand dunes, acquired at multiple frequencies and polarizations. Radar backscatter from sand dunes is very sensitive to the imaging geometry. At small incidence angles the radar return is mainly due to quasi-specular reflection from dune slopes favorably oriented toward the radar. A peak return usually occurs at the incidence angle equal to the angle of respose for the dunes. The peak angle is the same at all frequencies as computed from specular reflection theory. At larger angles the return is significantly weaker. The scatterometer measurements verified observations made with airborne and spaceborne radar images acquired over a number of dune fields in the United States, central Africa, and the Arabian peninsula. The imaging geometry constraints indicate that possible dunes on other planets, such as Venus, will probably not be detected in radar images unless the incidence angle is less than the angle of repose of such dunes and the radar look direction is approximately orthogonal to the dune trends.},

abstract = {Evidence for plumes of water on Europa has previously been found using the Hubble Space Telescope using two different observing techniques. Roth et al. found line emission from the dissociation products of water. Sparks et al. found evidence for off-limb continuum absorption as Europa transited Jupiter. Here, we present a new transit observation of Europa that shows a second event at the same location as a previous plume candidate from Sparks et al., raising the possibility of a consistently active source of erupting material on Europa. This conclusion is bolstered by comparison with a nighttime thermal image from the Galileo Photopolarimeter-Radiometer that shows a thermal anomaly at the same location, within the uncertainties. The anomaly has the highest observed brightness temperature on the Europa nightside. If heat flow from a subsurface liquid water reservoir causes the thermal anomaly, its depth is ≈1.8–2 km, under simple modeling assumptions, consistent with scenarios in which a liquid water reservoir has formed within a thick ice shell. Models that favor thin regions within the ice shell that connect directly to the ocean, however, cannot be excluded, nor modifications to surface thermal inertia by subsurface activity. Alternatively, vapor deposition surrounding an active vent could increase the thermal inertia of the surface and cause the thermal anomaly. This candidate plume region may offer a promising location for an initial characterization of Europa's internal water and ice and for seeking evidence of Europa's habitability.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the continuum emission of limb spectra acquired by the Cassini/CIRS infrared spectrometer in order to derive information on haze extinction in the 3-0.02mbar range (∼150-350km). We focused on the 600-1420cm-1 spectral range and studied nine different limb observations acquired during the Cassini nominal mission at 55°S, 20°S, 5°N, 30°N, 40°N, 45°N, 55°N, 70°N and 80°N. By means of an inversion algorithm solving the radiative transfer equation, we derived the vertical profiles of haze extinction coefficients from 17 spectral ranges of 20-cm-1 wide at each of the nine latitudes. At a given latitude, all extinction vertical profiles retrieved from various spectral intervals between 600 and 1120 cm-1 display similar vertical slopes implying similar spectral characteristics of the material at all altitudes. We calculated a mean vertical extinction profile for each latitude and derived the ratio of the haze scale height (Hhaze) to the pressure scale height (Hgas) as a function of altitude. We inferred Hhaze/Hgas values varying from 0.8 to 2.4. The aerosol scale height varies with altitude and also with latitude. Overall, the haze extinction does not show strong latitudinal variations but, at 1mbar, an increase by a factor of 1.5 is observed at the north pole compared to high southern latitudes. The vertical optical depths at 0.5 and 1.7mbar increase from 55°S to 5°N, remain constant between 5°N and 30°N and display little variation at higher latitudes, except the presence of a slight local maximum at 45°N. The spectral dependence of the haze vertical optical depth is uniform with latitude and displays three main spectral features centered at 630cm-1, 745cm-1 and 1390cm-1, the latter showing a wide tail extending down to ∼1000cm-1. From 600 to 750cm-1, the optical depth increases by a factor of 3 in contrast with the absorbance of laboratory tholins, which is generally constant. We derived the mass mixing ratio profiles of haze at the nine latitudes. Below the 0.4-mbar level all mass mixing ratio profiles increase with height. Above this pressure level, the profiles at 40°N, 45°N, 55°N, at the edge of the polar vortex, display a decrease-with-height whereas the other profiles increase. The global increase with height of the haze mass mixing ratio suggest a source at high altitudes and a sink at low altitudes. An enrichment of haze is observed at 0.1mbar around the equator, which could be due to a more efficient photochemistry because of the strongest insolation there or an accumulation of haze due to a balance between sedimentation and upward vertical drag. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Since Saturn orbital insertion in July 2004, the Cassini orbiter has been observing Titan throughout most of the northern winter season (October 2002-August 2009) and the beginning of spring, allowing a detailed monitoring of Titan's cloud coverage at high spatial resolution with close flybys on a monthly basis. This study reports on the analysis of all the near-infrared images of Titan's clouds acquired by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) during 67 targeted flybys of Titan between July 2004 and April 2010.The VIMS observations show numerous sporadic clouds at southern high and mid-latitudes, rare clouds in the equatorial region, and reveal a long-lived cloud cap above the north pole, ubiquitous poleward of 60°N. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the cloud coverage during almost a 6-year period including the equinox, and greatly help to further constrain global circulation models (GCMs). After 4. years of regular outbursts observed by Cassini between 2004 and 2008, southern polar cloud activity started declining, and completely ceased 1. year before spring equinox. The extensive cloud system over the north pole, stable between 2004 and 2008, progressively fractionated and vanished as Titan entered into northern spring. At southern mid-latitudes, clouds were continuously observed throughout the VIMS observing period, even after equinox, in a latitude band between 30°S and 60°S. During the whole period of observation, only a dozen clouds were observed closer to the equator, though they were slightly more frequent as equinox approached. We also investigated the distribution of clouds with longitude. We found that southern polar clouds, before disappearing in mid-2008, were systematically concentrated in the leading hemisphere of Titan, in particular above and to the east of Ontario Lacus, the largest reservoir of hydrocarbons in the area. Clouds are also non-homogeneously distributed with longitude at southern mid-latitudes. The n= 2-mode wave pattern of the distribution, observed since 2003 by Earth-based telescopes and confirmed by our Cassini observations, may be attributed to Saturn's tides. Although the latitudinal distribution of clouds is now relatively well reproduced and understood by the GCMs, the non-homogeneous longitudinal distributions and the evolution of the cloud coverage with seasons still need investigation. If the observation of a few single clouds at the tropics and at northern mid-latitudes late in winter and at the start of spring cannot be further interpreted for the moment, the obvious shutdown of the cloud activity at Titan's poles provides clear signs of the onset of the general circulation turnover that is expected to accompany the beginning of Titan's northern spring. According to our GCM, the persistence of clouds at certain latitudes rather suggests a 'sudden' shift in near future of the meteorology into the more illuminated hemisphere. Finally, the observed seasonal change in cloud activity occurred with a significant time lag that is not predicted by our model. This may be due to an overall methane humidity at Titan's surface higher than previously expected. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Radarclinometry is a powerful technique for estimating heights of landforms in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of planetary surfaces. In particular, it has been used to estimate heights of dunes in the sand seas of Saturn's moon Titan (Lorenz, R.D., and 39 colleagues [2006]. Science 312, 724–727). In this work, we verify the technique by comparing dune heights derived from radarclinometry to known topography of dune fields in the Namib sand sea of western Africa. We compared results from three different image grid spacings, and found that 350m/pixel (the same spacing at which the Cassini RADAR data was processed) is sufficient to determine dune height for dunes of similar morphometry to those of the Namib sand sea. At this grid spacing, height estimates derived from radarclinometry are largely representative of, though may underestimate by as much as 30{\%}, or overestimate by as much as 40{\%}, true dune height. Applying the technique to three regions on Titan, we estimate dune heights of 45–180m, and dune spacings of 2.3–3.3km. Obtaining accurate heights of Titan's dunes will help to constrain the total organic inventory on Titan.},

abstract = {Context. Clouds have already been detected in exoplanetary atmospheres. They play crucial roles in a planet's atmosphere and climate and can also create ambiguities in the determination of atmospheric parameters such as trace gas mixing ratios. Knowledge of cloud properties is required when assessing the habitability of a planet. Aims. We aim to show that various types of cloud cover such as polar cusps, subsolar clouds, and patchy clouds on Earth-like exoplanets can be distinguished from each other using the polarization and flux of light that is reflected by the planet. Methods. We have computed the flux and polarization of reflected starlight for different types of (liquid water) cloud covers on Earth-like model planets using the adding-doubling method, that fully includes multiple scattering and polarization. Variations in cloud-top altitudes and planet-wide cloud cover percentages were taken into account. Results. We find that the different types of cloud cover (polar cusps, subsolar clouds, and patchy clouds) can be distinguished from each other and that the percentage of cloud cover can be estimated within 10{\%}. Conclusions. Using our proposed observational strategy, one should be able to determine basic orbital parameters of a planet such as orbital inclination and estimate cloud coverage with reduced ambiguities from the planet's polarization signals along its orbit.},

abstract = {An analysis of Titan's solar phase variation as a function of wavelength together with the continuum geometric albedo makes it possible to set limits on the real part of the refractive index and on the average particle size of the aerosol component of Titan's atmosphere of between about 1.5 and 2.0 and between 0.20 microns and about 0.35 microns, respectively. If the real part of the refractive index is known the average particle size can be determined to within a few percent, and varies inversely with the real part of the refractive index. Using this information in a two-layer model of a methane-aerosol atmosphere and comparing the result with Titan's visible and near-infrared methane spectrum leads to the conclusion that the top layer of Titan's atmosphere contains 0.01 km atm of methane and 2.5 extinction optical depths of aerosol, while the data are consistent with a bottom layer containing 2.2 km atm of methane and about 7.5 aerosol optical depths for a real part of the refractive index equal to 1.7 and an average particle size of 0.25 microns.},

@article{Atreya2006,
abstract = {Methane is key to sustaining Titan's thick nitrogen atmosphere. However, methane is destroyed and converted to heavier hydrocarbons irreversibly on a relatively short timescale of approximately 10-100 million years. Without the warming provided by CH4-generated hydrocarbon hazes in the stratosphere and the pressure induced opacity in the infrared, particularly by CH4-N2 and H2-N2 collisions in the troposphere, the atmosphere could be gradually reduced to as low as tens of millibar pressure. An understanding of the source-sink cycle of methane is thus crucial to the evolutionary history of Titan and its atmosphere. In this paper we propose that a complex photochemical-meteorological-hydrogeochemical cycle of methane operates on Titan. We further suggest that although photochemistry leads to the loss of methane from the atmosphere, conversion to a global ocean of ethane is unlikely. The behavior of methane in the troposphere and the surface, as measured by the Cassini-Huygens gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, together with evidence of cryovolcanism reported by the Cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer, represents a "methalogical" cycle on Titan, somewhat akin to the hydrological cycle on Earth. In the absence of net loss to the interior, it would represent a closed cycle. However, a source is still needed to replenish the methane lost to photolysis. A hydrogeochemical source deep in the interior of Titan holds promise. It is well known that in serpentinization, hydration of ultramafic silicates in terrestrial oceans produces H2(aq), whose reaction with carbon grains or carbon dioxide in the crustal pores produces methane gas. Appropriate geological, thermal, and pressure conditions could have existed in and below Titan's purported water-ammonia ocean for "low-temperature" serpentinization to occur in Titan's accretionary heating phase. On the other hand, impacts could trigger the process at high temperatures. In either instance, storage of methane as a stable clathrate-hydrate in Titan's interior for later release to the atmosphere is quite plausible. There is also some likelihood that the production of methane on Titan by serpentinization is a gradual and continuous on-going process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the context of recent observations, microphys. models, and lab. data, a photochem. model of Titan's atm., including updated chem. focusing on rate coeffs. and cross sections measured under appropriate conditions, has been developed to increase understanding of these processes and improve upon previous Titan photochem. models. The model employs a two-stream discrete ordinates method to characterize the transfer of solar radiation, and the effects of electron-impact, cosmic-ray deposition, and aerosol opacities from fractal and Mie particles are analyzed. Sensitivity studies demonstrate that an eddy diffusion profile with a homopause level of 850 km and a methane stratospheric mole fraction of 2.2{\%} provides the best fit of stratospheric and upper atm. observations and an improved fit over previous Titan photochem. models. Lack of fits for C3H8, HC3N, and possibly C2H3CN can be resolved with adjustments in aerosol opacity. The model presents a benzene profile consistent with its detection in Titan's stratosphere Coustenis et al., 2003, which may play an important role in the formation of Titan hazes. An electron peak concn. of 4200 cm-3 is calcd., which exceeds observations by 20{\%}, considerably lower than previous ionosphere models. With adjustments in aerosol opacities and surface fluxes the model illustrates that reasonable fits to existing observations are possible with a single eddy diffusion profile, contrary to the conclusions of previous Titan models. These results will aid in the receipt and interpretation of data from Cassini-Huygens, which will arrive at Titan in 2004 and deploy a probe into Titan's atm. in Jan. 2005. on SciFinder (R)},

abstract = {The Ku-band (13.8 GHz - 2.2 cm) RADAR instrument onboard the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft has revealed the richness of the surface of Titan, as numerous seas, lakes, rivers, cryo-volcanic flows and vast dune fields have been discovered. Linear dunes are a major geomorphological feature present on Titan, covering up to 17{\%} of its surface, mainly in equatorial regions. However, the resolution of the RADAR instrument is not good enough to allow a detailed study of the morphology of these features. In addition, other linear wind-related landforms, such as mega-yardangs (linear wind-abraded ridges formed in cohesive rocks), are likely to present a comparable radar signature that could be confused with the one of dunes. We conducted a comparative study of the radar radiometry of both linear dunes and mega-yardangs, based on representative terrestrial analogues: the linear dunes located in the Great Sand Sea in western Egypt and in the Namib Desert in Namibia, and the mega-yardangs observed in the Lut Desert in eastern Iran and in the Borkou Desert in northern Chad. We analysed the radar scattering of both terrestrial linear dunes and mega-yardangs, using high-resolution radar images acquired by the X-band (9.6 GHz - 3.1 cm) sensor of the TerraSAR-X satellite. Variations seen in the radar response of dunes are the result of a contrast between the dune and interdune scattering, while for mega-yardangs these variations are the result of a contrast between ridges and erosion valleys. We tested a simple surface scattering model, with parameters derived from the local topography and surface roughness estimates, to accurately reproduce the radar signal variations for both landforms. It appears that we can discriminate between two types of dunes - bare interdunes as in Egypt and sand-covered interdunes as in Namibia, and between two types of mega-yardangs - young yardangs as in Iran and older ones as in Chad. We applied our understanding of the radar scattering to the analysis of Cassini RADAR T8 acquisitions over the Belet Sand Sea on Titan, and show that the linear dunes encountered there are likely to be of both Egyptian and Namibian type. We also show that the radar-bright linear features observed in Cassini RADAR T64 and T83 acquisitions are very likely to be mega-yardangs, possible remnants of ancient lake basins at mid-latitude, formed when Titan's climate was different.},

abstract = {Aerosols in Titan's atmosphere play an important role in determining its thermal structure. They also serve as sinks for organic vapours and can act as condensation nuclei for the formation of clouds, where the condensation efficiency will depend on the chemical composition of the aerosols. So far, however, no direct information has been available on the chemical composition of these particles. Here we report an in situ chemical analysis of Titan's aerosols by pyrolysis at 600 degrees C. Ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) have been identified as the main pyrolysis products. This clearly shows that the aerosol particles include a solid organic refractory core. NH3 and HCN are gaseous chemical fingerprints of the complex organics that constitute this core, and their presence demonstrates that carbon and nitrogen are in the aerosols.},

abstract = {We use 11 data sets of methane transmission measurements within 0.4–5.5{\$}\mu{\$}m wavelength to model the methane transmission for temperature and pressure conditions in the jovian planets. Eight data sets are based on published laboratory measurements. Another two data sets come from two spectrometers onboard the Huygens probe that measured methane absorption inside Titan's atmosphere (Tomasko et al., 2008b, PSS 56, 624), and we provide a refined analysis. The last data set is a set of new Jupiter images by the Hubble Space Telescope to measure atmospheric transmission with Ganymede as the light source. Below 1000nm wavelength, our resulting methane absorption coefficients are generally close to those by Karkoschka (1998, Icarus 133, 134), but we add descriptions of temperature and pressure dependence. One remaining inconsistency occurs between 882 and 902nm wavelength where laboratory data predict larger absorptions in the jovian atmospheres than observed. We present possible explanations. Above 1000nm, our analysis of the Huygens data confirms methane absorption coefficients by Irwin et al. (2006, Icarus 181, 309) at their laboratory temperatures. Huygens data also confirm Irwin's model of extrapolation to Titan's lower pressures. However, their model of extrapolation to Titan's lower temperatures predicts absorption coefficients up to 100 times lower than measured by Huygens. For each of ∼3700 wavelengths, we present a temperature dependence that is consistent with all laboratory data and the Huygens data. Since the Huygens data probe similar temperatures as many observations of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Titan, our methane model will allow more reliable radiative transfer models for their atmospheres.},

abstract = {High-energy photons, electrons, and ions initiate ion–neutral chemistry in Titan's upper atmosphere by ionizing the major neutral species (nitrogen and methane). The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft performed the first composition measurements of Titan's ionosphere. INMS revealed that Titan has the most compositionally complex ionosphere in the Solar System, with roughly 50 ions at or above the detection threshold. Modeling of the ionospheric composition constrains the density of minor neutral constituents, most of which cannot be measured with any other technique. The species identified with this approach include the most complex molecules identified so far on Titan. This confirms the long-thought idea that a very rich chemistry is actually taking place in this atmosphere. However, it appears that much of the interesting chemistry occurs in the upper atmosphere rather than at lower altitudes. The species observed by INMS are probably the first intermediates in the formation of even larger molecules. As a consequence, they affect the composition of the bulk atmosphere, the composition and optical properties of the aerosols and the flux of condensable material to the surface. In this paper, we discuss the production and loss reactions for the ions and how this affects the neutral densities. We compare our results to neutral densities measured in the stratosphere by other instruments, to production yields obtained in laboratory experiments simulating Titan's chemistry and to predictions of photochemical models. We suggest neutral formation mechanisms and highlight needs for new experimental and theoretical data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Inc. We have analyzed the complete archive of the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data in order to monitor and analyze the evolution of the clouds and haze coverage at both poles of Titan during the entire Cassini mission. Our objective is to give a cartographic synopsis from a VIMS perspective, to provide a global view of the seasonal evolution of Titan's atmosphere over the poles. We leave the detailed comparison with the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) data sets to further studies. We have computed global hyperspectral mosaics for each of the 127 targeted flybys of Titan to produce synthetic color maps emphasizing the main atmospheric features. The north pole appears fully covered by a huge cloud as soon as the first observations in 2004 and up to the equinox in 2009 (Le Mou{\'{e}}lic et al., 2012). The northern skies then became progressively clearer, after the circulation turnover in 2009, revealing the underlying lakes and seas to the optical instruments up to 2017. The reverse situation is observed over the south pole, which was mostly clear of such a high obscuring cloud during the first years of the mission, but started to develop a polar cloud in 2012. This feature grew up month after month until the end of the mission in 2017, with a poleward latitudinal extent of 75 °S in 2013 up to 58 °S in April 2017. Thanks to the spectral capabilities of VIMS, we have detected HCN spectral signatures over the north pole in almost all flybys between 2004 and 2008. These HCN signatures started then to show up over the south pole in almost all flybys between 2012 and 2017, so perfectly matching the timing and spatial extent of the northern and southern polar atmospheric features.},

@article{Griffith1998,
abstract = {The 1980 encounter by the Voyager 1 spacecraft with Titan, Saturn's largest moon, revealed the presence of a thick atmosphere containing nitrogen and methane (1.4 and approximately 0.05 bar, respectively). Methane was found to be nearly saturated at Titan's tropopause, which, with other considerations, led to the hypothesis that Titan might experience a methane analogue of Earth's vigorous hydrological cycle, with clouds, rain and seas. Yet recent analyses of Voyager data indicate large areas of super-saturated methane, more indicative of dry and stagnant conditions. A resolution to this apparent contradiction requires observations of Titan's lower atmosphere, which was hidden from the Voyager cameras by the photochemical haze (or smog) in Titan's stratosphere. Here we report near-infrared spectroscopic observations of Titan within four narrow spectral windows where the moon's atmosphere is ostensibly transparent. We detect pronounced flux enhancements that indicate the presence of reflective methane condensation clouds in the troposphere. These clouds occur at a relatively low altitude (15+/-10 km), at low latitudes, and appear to cover approximately 9 per cent of Titan's disk.},

@article{Sotin2012,
abstract = {Since Titan entered Northern spring in August 2009, the North Pole has been illuminated allowing observations at optical wavelengths. On June 5, 2010 the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft observed the Northern Pole area with a pixel size from 3 to 7km. Since, as we demonstrate, little of the solar flux at 5$\mu$m is scattered by the atmosphere, these observations were obtained at relatively large incidence angles and allowed us to build a mosaic covering an area of more than 500,000km 2 that overlaps and complements observations made by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in 2007. We find that there is an excellent correlation between the shape of the radar dark area, known as Ligeia Mare and the VIMS 5-$\mu$m dark unit. Matching most of the radar shoreline, the 2010 VIMS observations suggest that the 125,000-km 2 surface area of Ligeia Mare measured by RADAR in 2007 has not significantly changed. The VIMS observations complement the radar observations to the west of Ligeia Mare and suggest that Ligeia Mare is connected to Kraken Mare by either a diffuse network similar to a swamp area, or by well-defined, sub-pixel rivers. Considering the results of recent evaporation models of methane, our preferred interpretation of the relative constancy in surface area of Ligeia is that it is principally composed of ethane although we cannot rule out the possibility that methane evaporation is balanced with replenishment by either precipitation or underground seepage. There is also strong correlation between the location of the small radar lakes and the small VIMS 5-$\mu$m dark patches. The geographic location of the small lakes are within a VIMS pixel of the SAR location, suggesting that the non-synchronous component of Titan's spin rate, if it exists, was less than 2.3×10 -4deg/day between 2007 and 2010 in agreement with the recent T64 radar observations. These observations question the existence of non-synchronous rotation. Two radar-bright features appear dark at 5-$\mu$m. The simplest interpretation is that these are very shallow lakes, less than one meter deep. Three new small lakes, named Freeman, Cardiel, and Towada by the IAU, are found outside of the area mapped with the SAR. A single-scattering model describing reflection of sunlight at 5-$\mu$m suggests that the lake surface is mirror-like and that the albedo of the solid surfaces surrounding the lakes is about 8{\%}. These observations together with information of the haze aerosols allow us to show that Titan's lakes, atmospheric ethane and aerosol haze are smaller carbon reservoirs than Titan's sand dunes and atmospheric methane. A simple model involving an outburst of methane a few hundreds of Myr ago followed by the dissociation of methane in the atmosphere leading to the formation of the haze particles that constitute the dune fields would be consistent with both the present observations and recent measurements of isotopic ratios in atmospheric methane (Mandt, K.E. et al.

abstract = {We use data from the VIMS instrument on board the Cassini spacecraft to construct high sensitivity and high spatial-resolution maps of the locations of tropospheric clouds on Titan in the late northern winter season during which the Cassini prime mission took place. These observations show that, in this season, clouds on Titan are strongly hemispherically asymmetric. Mid-latitude clouds, in particular, occur only in the southern hemisphere and have not ever been observed in the north. Such an asymmetry is in general agreement with circulation models where sub-solar surface heating controls the locations of clouds and appears in conflict with models where perennial polar hazes prevent significant summertime polar heating from affecting the circulation. The southern mid-latitude clouds appear to be distributed uniformly in longitude, in contrast to some previous observations. Southern high-latitude clouds exhibit a significant concentration, however, between about 180° and 270°E longitude. A spatially and temporally uniform cloud always appears northward of ∼50°N latitude. This cloud appears unchanged over the course of the observations, consistent with the interpretation that it is caused by continuous ethane condensation as air subsides and radiatively cools through the tropopause. The location of this cloud likely provides a direct tracer of elements of north polar atmospheric circulation, potentially allowing continuous monitoring of circulation changes as Titan passes through equinox into north polar spring and summer. We show that a similar analysis of this dataset by Rodriguez et al. (2009) contains substantial errors and should not be used. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An emission feature at 220 cm–1 which has been attributed to a cloud of condensed material in Titan's winter stratosphere has been seen for the first time in the south. This feature had previously been found only at high northern latitudes during northern winter and spring. The material emitting at 220 cm–1, as yet unidentified, may be volatiles associated with nitrile gases that accumulate in the absence of ultraviolet sunlight. Not detected as recently as 2012 February, the 220 cm–1 feature clearly appeared at the south pole in Cassini spectra recorded on 2012 July 24, indicating a rapid onset of the emission. This is the first indication of the winter buildup of condensation in the southern stratosphere that has been expected as the south pole moves deeper into shadow. In the north the 220 cm–1 feature continued to decrease in intensity with a half-life of 3 years.},

abstract = {Full-disk albedo spectra of the jovian planets and Titan were derived from observations at the European Southern Observatory in July 1995. The spectra extend from 300 to 1050 nm wavelength. The spectral resolution is 0.4 nm between 520 and 995 nm, and 1 nm elsewhere. The accuracy of the albedo calibration is 4{\{}{\%}{\}}. UBV magnitudes were also determined. Raman scattering was quantified for each planet. Methane and ammonia bands are shown at 0.4 nm spectral resolution, including a new band at 930 nm wavelength which is probably due to ammonia. Maps of the variation of these absorptions across the disks of Jupiter and Saturn are displayed. Saturn's spectrum is undisturbed by light from its rings due to the edge-on geometry during the observations. The albedo of Uranus near 1 mum wavelength has dropped almost 10{\{}{\%}{\}} between 1993 and 1995, while there has been no change in the ultraviolet. The signature of light from Titan's surface yielded a path length of 4 km-am of methane in Titan's atmosphere. The temperature dependence of the width of the 890-nm methane band was used to measure temperature variations at three altitude levels, resulting in the first temperature maps of Jupiter and Saturn based on reflected sunlight. Jupiter displays a banded temperature structure with some discrete features of a few Kelvin amplitude. Saturn's north-south temperature asymmetry has reversed since the Voyager observations.},

abstract = {We present the first published analysis of a solar occultation by Titan's atmosphere measured by the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph on board Cassini. The data were measured during flyby T53 in 2009 April and correspond to latitudes between 21° and 28° south. The analysis utilizes the absorption of two solar emission lines (584 {\{}{\AA}{\}} and 630 {\{}{\AA}{\}}) in the ionization continuum of the N2 absorption cross section and solar emission lines around 1085 {\{}{\AA}{\}} where absorption is due to CH4. The measured transmission at these wavelengths provides a direct estimate of the N2 and CH4 column densities along the line of sight from the spacecraft to the Sun, which we inverted to obtain the number densities. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the data allowed us to retrieve density profiles in the altitude range 1120-1400 km for nitrogen and 850-1300 km for methane. We find an N2 scale height of {\{}{\~{}}{\}}76 km and a temperature of {\{}{\~{}}{\}}153 K. Our results are in general agreement with those from previous work, although there are some differences. Particularly, our profiles agree, considering uncertainties, with the density profiles derived from the Voyager 1 Ultraviolet Spectrograph data, and with in situ measurements by the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer with revised calibration.},

abstract = {Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) has been observing Titan since April 2004, compiling a nearly global surface map and monitoring the surface and atmosphere for activity. Early images of the south-polar region revealed numerous dark surface features and contemporaneous convective cloud systems, suggesting the presence of hydrocarbon lakes similar to those later detected at Titan's North Pole. Intriguingly, repeated south-polar imaging by ISS revealed differences consistent with ponding of hydrocarbon liquids on the surface due to precipitation from a large storm. More recent ISS images of high northern latitudes illustrate the full extents ({\textgreater} 500,000 km(2)) of hydrocarbon seas, sections of which have been observed by Cassini's RADAR. These observations demonstrate dynamic processes at work on Titan and that the poles harbor liquid-hydrocarbon reservoirs, the extents of which differ from pole to pole and which may be coupled to seasonally varying circulation.

[2008]. Planet. Space Sci. 56, 669–707). Our calculations include the condensation of methane, ethane and hydrogen cyanide on photochemical aerosols produced in the thermosphere. Our results suggest that the two distinct extinction layers observed by DISR below 80km are produced by HCN and methane condensation, while for the Huygens' equatorial conditions simulated here, the contribution of ethane clouds to the total opacity is negligible. The HCN mass flux is comparable to the mass flux of aerosols, thus the majority of the HCN cloud particles have a similar size with the aerosol particles, they are HCN-coated aerosols. Ethane cloud particles have sizes between 2 and 10{\$}\mu{\$}m depending on altitude, and methane clouds grow to an average size of ∼100{\$}\mu{\$}m before starting to evaporate below 10km. The reproduction by the simulation of the main features observed by DISR suggests that the atmospheric snapshot acquired by the Huygens instruments corresponds to a condition very close to the steady state simulated here. This points to the stability of the equatorial atmospheric conditions at the time of the descent. Moreover, we investigate the resulting abundance of ethane in the lower part of the atmosphere and its impact on the flux of condensates to the surface. Our results suggest that under the steady state conditions investigated, ethane condensates evaporate before reaching the surface and that the ethane gas abundance close to the surface is well below its saturation limit.},

The like-polarized scattering coefficients contain single scattering terms and multiple scattering terms. The single scattering terms are shown to reduce to the first-order solutions derived from the small perturbation method when the roughness parameters satisfy the slightly rough conditions. When surface roughnesses are large but the surface slope is small, only a single scattering term corresponding to the standard Kirchhoff model is significant. If the surface slope is large, the multiple scattering term will also be significant. The cross-polarized backscattering coefficients satisfy reciprocity and contain only multiple scattering terms. The difference between vertical and horizontal scattering coefficients increases with the dielectric constant and is generally smaller than that predicted by the first-order small perturbation model. Good agreements are obtained between this model and measurements from statistically known surfaces},

abstract = {Titan's extended haze is a prominent and long-lived feature of the atmosphere that encompasses a rich variety of chemical, dynamical and microphysical processes operating over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. The so-called 'detached' haze layer is easily seen in high-resolution short-wave (near-UV and blue wavelengths) images and is a consequence of a nearly global (outside of the winter polar hood region) layer depleted in aerosol content. It was first seen near 350 Km altitude in Voyager images (Rages and Pollack, 1983) and later observed by the Cassini ISS cameras (Porco et al., 2005; West et al., 2010) and UV stellar occultation profiles (Koskinen et al. 2011). A series of Cassini images from 2009 to 2010 revealed what appears to be a seasonally related altitude variation with remarkable regularity (comparing the Voyager and Cassini images). The drop in altitude is most rapid at equinox. Here we report on images of the upper haze layer over the period 2012 to early 2016. In the early part of this period the detached haze continued to drop in altitude and disappeared. There was no evidence for it beginning late in 2012 and extending to early 2016 when it was again detected with very low contrast at an altitude near 500 Km. We document this behavior and examine the evolution of the haze as functions of both latitude and time. These new details put additional constraints on models that attempt to account for the existence of the detached layer. Part of this work was done by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. References: Rages, K., and J. B.

abstract = {Iapetus has preserved evidence that constrains the modeling of its geophysical history from the time of its accretion until now. The evidence is (a) its present 79.33-day rotation or spin rate, (b) its shape that corresponds to the equilibrium figure for a hydrostatic body rotating with a period of ∼16 h, and (c) its high, equatorial ridge, which is unique in the Solar System. This paper reports the results of an investigation into the coupling between Iapetus' thermal and orbital evolution for a wide range of conditions including the spatial distributions with time of composition, porosity, short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRI), and temperature. The thermal model uses conductive heat transfer with temperature-dependent conductivity. Only models with a thick lithosphere and an interior viscosity in the range of about the water ice melting point can explain the observed shape. Short-lived radioactive isotopes provide the heat needed to decrease porosity in Iapetus' early history. This increases thermal conductivity and allows the development of the strong lithosphere that is required to preserve the 16-h rotational shape and the high vertical relief of the topography. Long-lived radioactive isotopes and SLRI raise internal temperatures high enough that significant tidal dissipation can start, and despin Iapetus to synchronous rotation. This occurred several hundred million years after Iapetus formed. The models also constrain the time when Iapetus formed because the successful models are critically dependent upon having just the right amount of heat added by SLRI decay in this early period. The amount of heat available from short-lived radioactivity is not a free parameter but is fixed by the time when Iapetus accreted, by the canonical concentration of 26Al, and, to a lesser extent, by the concentration of 60Fe. The needed amount of heat is available only if Iapetus accreted between 2.5 and 5.0 Myr after the formation of the calcium aluminum inclusions as found in meteorites. Models with these features allow us to explain Iapetus' present synchronous rotation, its fossil 16-h shape, and the context within which the equatorial ridge arose. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We have developed a new 3-dimensional climate model for Titan's atmosphere, using the physics of the IPSL Titan 2-dimensional climate model with the current version of the LMDZ General Circulation Model dynamical core. Microphysics and photochemistry are still computed as zonal averages. This GCM covers altitudes from surface to 500. km altitude, with barotropic waves now being resolved and the diurnal cycle included. The boundary layer scheme has been changed, yielding a strong improvement in the tropospheric zonal wind profile modeled at Huygens descent position and season. The potential temperature profile is fairly consistent with Huygens observations in the lowest 10. km. The latitudinal profile of the near-surface temperature is close to observed values. The minimum of zonal wind observed by the Huygens probe just above the tropopause is also present in these simulations, and its origin is discussed by comparing solar heating and dynamical transport of energy. The stratospheric temperature and wind fields are consistent with our previous works. Compared to observations, the zonal wind peak is too weak (around 120. m/s) and too low (around 200. km). The temperature structures appear to be compressed in altitude, and depart strongly from observations in the upper stratosphere. These discrepancies are correlated, and most probably related to the altitude of the haze production. The model produces a detached haze layer located more than 150. km lower than observed by the Cassini instruments. This low production altitude is due to the current position of the GCM upper boundary. However, the temporal behaviour of the detached haze layer in the model may explain the seasonal differences observed between Cassini and Voyager 1. The waves present in the GCM are analyzed, together with their respective roles in the angular momentum budget. Though the role of the mean meridional circulation in momentum transport is similar to previous work, and the transport by barotropic waves is clearly seen in the stratosphere, a significant part of the transport at high latitudes is done all year long through low-frequency tropospheric waves that may be baroclinic waves. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We have deduced the scattering properties of aerosols in the jovian upper troposphere by analyzing imaging data obtained at a wide variety of solar phase angles (4-140°) by the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) during its flyby of Jupiter. The limb-darkening curves along the South Tropical Zone (STrZ) are extracted from CB2 images (effective wavelength: 750nm) to constrain the single scattering phase functions of aerosols. The best-fit Mie scattering phase function for cloud is obtained with the real part of the refractive index n r,cloud=1.85 and the effective radius r eff,cloud=0.3$\mu$m. The best-fit combination of n r,cloud and r eff,cloud would strongly suggest the idea that the abundant small particle population in the upper troposphere is not composed of pure NH 3 ice. Although the optical properties of the stratospheric haze are not well constrained compared with those of cloud, the haze is found to be optically thin ({\textless}0.06) and to be strongly forward scattering (effective radius r eff,haze=0.5$\mu$m).We compare our results with the scattering phase function at red wavelength (640. nm) for the STrZ derived by Tomasko et al. (Tomasko, M.G., West, R.A., Castillo, N.D. [1978]. Icarus 33, 558-592), which was deduced from analysis of the Pioneer 10 Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) data (12-150° for solar phase angles). Our new Mie scattering phase function can reproduce the Pioneer 10 observations well. In contrast, their scattering phase function described by the double Henyey-Greenstein function does not reproduce the Cassini ISS observations. This is attributed to the fact that their scattering phase function is underconstrained, primarily due to a considerable gap in observations for an intermediate solar phase angle range (34-109°).Our new Mie scattering phase function has advantages over that of Tomasko et al. (Tomasko, M.G., West, R.A., Castillo, N.D. [1978]. Icarus 33, 558-592).(1)Since the Cassini ISS data do not have a large gap in solar phase angle, the new Mie scattering phase function is better constrained.(2)The Mie scattering phase function can be applied easily to different wavelengths.With such characteristics, we now have a reliable baseline scattering phase function that can be used to interpret the ever-changing appearance of jovian clouds as changes of the vertical cloud structure and/or distribution of chromophores in the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Context. The chemical nature of the Titan haze is poorly understood. The investigation carried out by the Cassini-Huygens suite of instruments is bringing new insights into this question. Aims: This work aims at deriving the vertical variation of the spectral structure of the 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m absorption feature of the Titan haze from Cassini VIMS solar occultation data recorded between 250 and 700 km altitude. Methods: We computed the transmittance of Titan's atmosphere using a spherical shell model and a radiative transfer code including the influence of CH4, CH3D, and C2H6, as well as the effects of absorption and scattering by the haze particles. We derived the haze extinction from a comparison of the synthetic spectra with the VIMS solar occultation spectra. Results: We find a marked change in the relative amplitudes of the 3.33 and 3.38 $\mu$m features, which are characteristic of aromatic (double C=C chains or rings) or aliphatic (single C-C chains) structural groups, respectively. The pseudo-ratio of aromatics to aliphatics (uncorrected for the absolute band strengths) varies from 3.3 ± 1.9 at 580-700 km to 0.9 ± 0.1 at 350-450 km, and is 0.5 ± 0.1 around 250 km. The structural change from the aromatic to the aliphatic type between 580 and 480 km appears to correspond to a spontaneous aging of the particles - a transition between unannealed and hardened particles - while the further decrease of the pseudo-ratio of aromatics to aliphatics below 480 km may be related to the coating of the core particles by condensates such as heavy alkanes.

@article{Larson2015,
abstract = {We use a 3D GCM with coupled aerosol microphysics to investigate the formation and seasonal cycle of the detached haze layer in Titan's upper atmosphere. The base of the detached haze layer is defined by a local minimum in the vertical extinction profile. The detached haze is seen at all latitudes including the south pole as seen in Cassini images from 2005-2012. The layer merges into the winter polar haze at high latitudes where the Hadley circulation carries the particles downward. The hemisphere in which the haze merges with the polar haze varies with season. We find that the base of the detached haze layer occurs where there is a near balance between vertical winds and particle fall velocities. Generally the vertical variation of particle concentration in the detached haze region is simply controlled by sedimentation, so the concentration and the extinction vary roughly in proportion to air density. This variation explains why the upper part of the main haze layer, and the bulk of the detached haze layer follow exponential profiles. However, the shape of the profile is modified in regions where the vertical wind velocity is comparable to the particle fall velocity. Our simulations closely match the period when the base of the detached layer in the tropics is observed to begin its seasonal drop in altitude, and the total range of the altitude drop. However, the simulations have the base of the detached layer about 100. km lower than observed, and the time for the base to descend is slower in the simulations than observed. These differences may point to the model having somewhat lower vertical winds than occur on Titan, or somewhat too large of particle sizes, or some combination of both. Our model is consistent with a dynamical origin for the detached haze rather than a chemical or microphysical one. This balance between the vertical wind and particle fall velocities occurs throughout the summer hemisphere and tropics. The particle concentration gradients that are established in the summer hemisphere are transported to the winter hemisphere by meridional winds from the overturning Hadley cell. Our model is consistent with the disappearance of the detached haze layer in early 2014. Our simulations predict the detached haze and gap will reemerge at its original high altitude between mid 2014 and early 2015.},

We set the mass production of aerosols in the thermosphere to 3??10-14gcm-2 s-1 and follow the evolution of the particles due to coagulation, sedimentation and atmospheric mixing. We use the observed aerosol phase functions at 100km to constrain the particle's charge density to 15e/??m. With this charge density, the microphysical model predictions for the number of monomers, and the particle size and density, are in good agreement with the DISR measurements. In addition, we derive a new refractive index for the aerosols based on the single scattering albedo inferred from DISR measurements. The imaginary index is larger than previous estimates based on laboratory analogs, with an increasing absorption toward the near-IR. Our simulation provides a good description of the particle properties above 80km, but we find that condensation effects must be included in order to interpret aerosol characteristics at lower altitudes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Mountain peak morphologies and surrounding, diffuse blankets give evidence that erosion has acted upon these features, perhaps in the form of fluvial runoff. Possible formation mechanisms for these mountains include crustal compressional tectonism and upthrusting of blocks, extensional tectonism and formation of horst-and-graben, deposition as blocks of impact ejecta, or dissection and erosion of a preexisting layer of material. All above processes may be at work, given the diversity of geology evident across Titan's surface. Comparisons of mountain and blanket volumes and erosion rate estimates for Titan provide a typical mountain age as young as 20–100 million years.},

@article{Carslaw1998,
abstract = {Chemical reactions on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles are responsible for the production of reactive chlorine species (chlorine 'activation') which cause ozone destruction(1). Gas-phase deactivation of these chlorine species can take several weeks in the Arctic winter stratosphere, so that ozone destruction can be sustained even in air parcels that encounter PSCs only intermittently(2,3). Chlorine activation during a PSC encounter proceeds much faster at low temperatures when cloud particle surface area and heterogeneous reaction rates are higher(4). Although mountain-induced atmospheric gravity waves are known to cause local reductions in stratospheric temperature of as much as 10-15 K (refs 5-9), and are often associated with mesoscale PSCs10-12, their effect on chlorine activation and ozone depletion has not been considered. Here we describe aircraft observations of mountain-wave-induced mesoscale PSCs in which temperatures were 12 K lower than expected synoptically, Model calculations show that despite their localized nature, these PSCs can cause almost complete conversion of inactive chlorine species to ozone-destroying forms in air flowing through the clouds. Using a global mountain-wave model(8), we identify regions where mountain waves can develop, and show that they can cause frequent chlorine activation of air in the Arctic stratosphere. Such mesoscale processes offer a possible explanation for the underprediction of reactive chlorine concentrations and ozone depletion rates calculated by three-dimensional models of the Arctic stratosphere(13-17).},

abstract = {Seasonal CO2 and H2O ices play a major role in the current climate of Mars. Their condensa- tion/sublimation cycle largely control the variations of atmospheric pressure and humidity. The aim of this thesis is to provide new observational constraints to the surface/atmosphere interactions during the retreat of the northern seasonal deposits. Using near infrared hyperspectral images from the OMEGA instrument (Mars Express), the extent of the seasonal CO2 and H2O ices was mapped from winter sol- stice to summer solstice. A water ice annulus systematically surrounds the CO2-rich seasonal deposits. It is an important source of water vapor during its sublimation. A water ice layer progressively covers the CO2 ice. It results from two processes : accumulation of water ice grains previously embedded into CO2 ice and laying onto the surface while CO2 ice sublimes, and condensation of water vapor coming from the sublimating water ice annulus. Sudden increases of the CO2 ice signatures are observed in the spiral troughs and scarps of the North permanent cap and in the circumpolar dark dunes field. It probably results from an enhancement of the katabatic winds due to transient low pressure systems. These dynamical processes result in an inhomogeneous accumulation of water frost onto the North permanent cap at the beginning of summer which could play a role in the present evolution of the cap. Knowledge of the water vapor sources location and of the surface/atmosphere interactions during northern winter and spring will improve climate models and our understanding of the current water cycle on Mars.},

abstract = {The problem of regolith densification is examined with application to Titan, with the objective of establishing the pore volume in the regolith, A large pore volume could store the large volume of hydrocarbons required to exist on Titan's surface by photochemical models, forming a "buried ocean", a surface model more compatible with observational constraints than the global ocean model favored in the last decade. A sophisticated coupled model of methane diffusion and regolith densification is presented. It is found that several hundred meters equivalent "ocean" depth can be concealed in the regolith. Further, methane diffusion through the regolith is fast enough to maintain the atmospheric methane concentration against photolysis, "Hydrothermal" methane circulation may play a significant role in surface chemistry and heat transport.

abstract = {We introduce a new 1D coupled Radiative/Convective-Photochemical-Microphysical model for a planetary atmosphere and apply it to Titan. The model incorporates detailed radiation transfer calculations for the description of the shortwave and longwave fluxes which provide the vertical structure of the radiation field and temperature profile. These are used for the generation of the photochemistry inside the atmosphere from the photolysis of Titan's main constituents, nitrogen (N2) and methane (CH4). The resulting hydrocarbons and nitriles are used for the production of the haze precursors, whose evolution is described by the microphysical part of the model. The calculated aerosol and gas opacities are iteratively included in the radiation transfer calculations in order to investigate their effect on the resulting temperature profile and geometric albedo. The main purpose of this model is to help in the understanding of the missing link between the gas production and particle transformation in Titan's atmosphere. In this part, the basic physical mechanisms included in the model are described. The final results regarding the eddy mixing profile, the chemical composition and the role of the different haze precursors suggested in the literature are presented in Part II along with the sensitivity of the results to the molecular nitrogen photoinization scheme and the impact of galactic cosmic rays in the atmospheric chemistry.},

abstract = {This report summarizes the many advances that have been made in the study of planetary Aeolian processes that have taken place since the first Planetary Dunes Workshop was held in May of 2008, through 2011. Many of the recent studies are facilitated by the wealth and variety of high resolution imaging and spectra data still being returned by multiple spacecraft in orbit and on the surface of Mars, as well as Cassini radar and imaging data for the unique linear dunes on Titan, the large moon of Saturn. The report is divided into seven broad topics: exploring the Martian rock record, the action of the wind, sediment composition, sediment transport, Aeolian bedforms, modification processes, and Titan. Analog studies of terrestrial landforms and processes continue to improve our understanding of the operation of Aeolian processes on other planetary surfaces in each of these topics. Four subjects are likely to see increased emphasis during the coming years: Martian aeolianites, sand compositional diversity, active versus inactive features, and deposition versus erosion. Continued growth of the planetary Aeolian literature is expected as several spacecraft continue to provide high-quality data, including the successful arrival of the Curiosity rover at Mars in August of 2012.},

We present evidence for surface deposits of solid benzene (C6H6), solid and/or liquid ethane (C2H6), or methane (CH4), and clouds of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) aerosols using diagnostic spectral features in data from the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). Cyanoacetylene (2-propynenitrile, IUPAC nomenclature, HC3N) is indicated in spectra of some bright regions, but the spectral resolution of VIMS is insufficient to make a unique identification although it is a closer match to the feature previously attributed to CO2. We identify benzene, an aromatic hydrocarbon, in larger abundances than expected by some models. Acetylene (C2H2), expected to be more abundant on Titan according to some models than benzene, is not detected. Solid acetonitrile (CH3CN) or other nitriles might be candidates for matching other spectral features in some Titan spectra. An as yet unidentified absorption at 5.01-mm indicates that yet another compound exists on Titan's surface. We place upper limits for liquid methane and ethane in some locations on Titan and find local areas consistent with millimeter path lengths. Except for potential lakes in the southern and northern polar regions, most of Titan appears "dry." Finally, we find there is little evidence for exposed water ice on the surface. Water ice, if present, must be covered with organic compounds to the depth probed by 1-5-mm photons: a few millimeters to centimeters.},

@article{Tokano1999,
abstract = {The seasonal variation of Titan's atmospheric structure with emphasis on the stratosphere is simulated by a three-dimensional general circulation model. The model includes the transport of haze particles by the circulation. The likely pattern of meridional circulation is reconstructed by a comparison of simulated and observed haze and temperature distribution. The GCM produces a weak zonal circulation with a small latitudinal temperature gradient, in conflict with observation. The direct reason is found to be the excessive meridional circulation. Under uniformly distributed opacity sources, the model predicts a pair of symmetric Hadley cells near the equinox and a single global cell with the rising branch in the summer hemisphere below about z = 230 km and a thermally indirect cell above the direct cell near the solstice. The interhemispheric circulation transports haze particles from the summer to the winter hemisphere, causing a maximum haze opacity contrast near the solstice and a smaller contrast near the equinox, contrary to observation. On the other, if the GCM is run under modified cooling rate in order to account for the enhancement in nitrites and some hydrocarbons in the northern hemisphere near the vernal equinox, the meridional cell at the equinox becomes a single cell with rising motions in the autumn hemisphere. A more realistic haze opacity distribution can be reproduced at the equinox. However, a pure transport effect (without particle growth by microphysics, etc.) would not be able to cause the observed discontinuity of the global haze opacity distribution at any location. The stratospheric temperature asymmetry can be explained by a combination of asymmetric radiative heating rates and adiabatic heating due to vertical motion within the thermally indirect cell. A seasonal variation of haze particle number density is unlikely to be responsible for this asymmetry. It is likely that a thermally indirect cell covers the upper portion of the main haze layer. An artificial damping of the meridional circulation enables the formation of high-latitude jets in the upper stratosphere and weaker equatorial superrotation. The latitudinal temperature distribution in the stratosphere is better reproduced.},

Since 2005, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) instrument on board the Cassini mission performs a continuous survey of the Titan's atmosphere and confirmed its persistence at 500 km up to the equinox (2009) before its drop and disappearance in 2012 (West et al. 2011). Previous analyses showed, that this layer corresponds to the transition area between small spherical aerosols and large fractal aggregates and play a key role in the aerosols formation in Titan's atmosphere (Rannou et al. 2000, Lavvas et al. 2009, Cours et al. 2011).In this talk we will present the UV photometric analyses based on radiative transfer inversion to retrieve aerosols particles properties in the DHL (bulk and monomer radius and local density) performed on ISS observations taken from 2005 to 2007.References:- Rages and Pollach, Icarus 55 (1983)- West, et al., Icarus 38 (2011)- Rannou, et al., Icarus 147 (2000)- Lavvas, et al., Icarus 201 (2009)- Cours, et al., ApJ Lett. 741 (2015)},

abstract = {The VIMS instrument onboard Cassini observed the north polar region of Titan at 113° phase angle, 28 December 2006. On this spectral image, a vast polar cloud can be seen northward to 62°N, and elsewhere, the haze appears as the dominant source of scattering. Because the surface does not appear in the wavelength range between 0.3 and 4.9{\$}\mu{\$}m, this spectro-image is ideal to study airborn scatterers both in methane bands and windows. In this work, we study this image, along with another image taken at 13° phase angle. This image probe both the atmosphere and the surface from pole to pole. First, we characterise the spatial distribution of the haze layer above 100. km between 80°S and 70°N. We find a north south asymmetry with a haze opacity increasing by a factor 3 from the south pole to the equator, then a constant value up to about 30°N and a decrease of a factor 2 between 30°N and about 60°N. Beyond 60°N, we can see the influence of the north polar cloud, even in the band, but no polar haze accumulation. The fact that the north polar region is still in the polar night is a possible explanation. No haze accumulation is observed in the southern polar region. Secondly, we partly identify the origin of spectral features in the 2.8-{\$}\mu{\$}m methane window, which are found to be due to deuterated methane (CH3D). This allows the analyse of this window and to retrieve the opacity of scatterers layer below 80. km (presumably made of aerosols and condensate droplets) between 35°N and 60°N. Finally, we constrained the values and the spectral behaviour of the imaginary part of the aerosol refractive index in the range between 0.3 and 4{\$}\mu{\$}m. To do so, we studied the 2.8-{\$}\mu{\$}m window with the image taken at 113° phase angle. To complete the analysis, we studied the transmission through the haze layer in the 3.4-{\$}\mu{\$}m band observed in solar occultation mode with VIMS, and we analysed the single scattering albedo retrieved with DISR instrument between 0.4 and 1.6{\$}\mu{\$}m. The imaginary part of the refractive index that we find for Titan aerosols follows Khare et al. (Khare, B.N. et al. [1984]. Icarus 60, 127-137) optical constant up to 0.8{\$}\mu{\$}m and becomes constant beyond this wavelength at least up to 1.6{\$}\mu{\$}m. It also has a prominent peak at 3.4{\$}\mu{\$}m and a secondary peak at 3{\$}\mu{\$}m, which indicates material rich in C-H bonds, with much less N-H bonds than in Khare et al. (1984) tholins. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Two independent determinations of the corresponding degree-2 Love number yield k(2) = 0.589 ± 0.150 and k(2) = 0.637 ± 0.224 (2$\sigma$).

Using measurements from a combination of mass/charge and energy/charge spectrometers on the Cassini spacecraft, we have obtained evidence for tholin formation at high altitudes (approximately 1000 kilometers) in Titan's atmosphere. The observed chemical mix strongly implies a series of chemical reactions and physical processes that lead from simple molecules (CH4 and N2) to larger, more complex molecules (80 to 350 daltons) to negatively charged massive molecules (approximately 8000 daltons), which we identify as tholins.

Recent telescope and Cassini orbiter observations are now providing an insight into cloud climatology. To study clouds, we have developed a general circulation model of Titan that includes cloud microphysics. We identify and explain the formation of several types of ethane and methane clouds, including south polar clouds and sporadic clouds in temperate regions and especially at 40 degrees in the summer hemisphere. The locations, frequencies, and composition of these cloud types are essentially explained by the large-scale circulation.},

abstract = {Linear geomorphology features on Earth are well-studied using geological field observations and remote sensing (optical, radar). These structures can be divided into two groups: the wind-deposit and accumulation areas known as linear sand dunes; and the wind-abraded ridges on eroded cohesive rocks known as mega-yardangs. In this study, we performed a comparative planetology approach to discriminate between these two features on Saturn's moon Titan, by comparing the radar signature of their terrestrial analogues. The Ku-band (13.8 GHz) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) onboard the Cassini spacecraft is able to sense through the optically-opaque atmosphere of Titan, but the resolution of this instrument (200 m) is not sufficient to clearly observe the morphology of linear structures. We then considered orbital radar images of terrestrial structures, provided by the high resolution (18 m) X-band radar (9.6 GHz) of the TerraSAR-X mission. We acquired images of the Great Sand Sea (Egypt) and the Namib Desert (Namibia) for the linear dunes; and of the Lut Desert (Iran) and the Djurab Desert (Chad) for the mega-yardangs. We modeled the geometrical effect of the topography using DEM models provided by SRTM and GDEM, and the surface roughness effect was estimated using single scattering models such as Integral Equation model and Geometrical Optics model. We were able to reproduce in a quite faithful way the backscattered radar signal by terrestrial dunes and mega-yardangs. These results were applied on Titan to the analysis of T8 and T49 flybys over the Bellet equatorial region, which contains linear dune fields, and to the analysis of T64 and T83 flybys, which show potential mega-yardang structures. Based on our quantitative radar modeling results, we can confirm that linear structures in T64 and T83 are actually mega-yardangs. As on Earth mega-yardang are usually formed over former lakes depressions on homogeneous rocks with a strong and stable unidirectional wind erosion over million years. Their existence on Titan could indicate that lakes were existing in lower latitude regions in the past, providing a new constrain for past climatic models of Titan.},

Molecular analysis of the volatile component of this tholin was performed by sequential and non-sequential pyrolytic gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. More than one hundred organic compounds are released; tentative identifications include saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, substituted polycyclic aromatics, nitriles, amines, pyrroles, pyrazines, pyridines, pyrimidines, and the purine, adenine. In addition, acid hydrolysis produces a racemic mixture of biological and non-biological amino acids.

abstract = {Titan, the main satellite of Saturn, has been observed by remote sensing for many years, both from interplanetary probes (Pioneer and Voyager's flybys) and from the Earth. Its N2 atmosphere, containing a small fraction of CH4 (≈2{\%}), with T ≈ 90 K and P ≈ 1.5 bar at the ground level, is irradiated by solar UV photons and deeply bombarded by energetic particles, i.e. Saturn magnetospheric electrons and protons, interplanetary electrons and cosmic rays. The resulting energy deposition, which takes place mainly below 1000 km, initiates chemical reactions which yield gaseous hydrocarbons and nitriles and, through polymerisation processes, solid aerosol particles which grow by coagulation and settle down to the ground. At the present time, photochemical models strongly require the results of specific laboratory studies. Chemical rate constants are not well known at low temperatures, charged-particle-induced reactions are difficult to model and laboratory simulations of atmospheric processes are therefore of great interest. Moreover, the synthesis of organic compounds which have not been detected to date provides valuable information for future observations. The origin and chemical composition of aerosols depend on the nature of chemical and energy sources. Their production from gaseous species may be monitored in laboratory chambers and their optical or microphysical properties compared to those deduced from the observations of Titan's atmosphere. The development of simulation chambers of Titan's extreme conditions is necessary for a better understanding of past and future observations. Space probes will sound Titan's atmosphere by remote sensing and in situ analysis in the near future (Cassini-Huygens mission). It appears necessary, as a preliminary step, to test on-board experiments in such chambers, and as a final step, when new space data have been acquired, to use them for more general scientific purposes. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {TitanWRF general circulation model simulations performed without sub-grid-scale horizontal diffusion of momentum produce roughly the observed amount of superrotation in Titan's stratosphere. We compare these results to Cassini-Huygens measurements of Titan's winds and temperatures, and predict temperature and winds at future seasons. We use angular momentum and transformed Eulerian mean diagnostics to show that equatorial superrotation is generated during episodic angular momentum 'transfer events' during model spin-up, and maintained by similar (yet shorter) events once the model has reached steady state. We then use wave and barotropic instability analysis to suggest that these transfer events are produced by barotropic waves, generated at low latitudes then propagating poleward through a critical layer, thus accelerating low latitudes while decelerating the mid-to-high latitude jet in the late fall through early spring hemisphere. Finally, we identify the dominant waves responsible for the transfers of angular momentum close to northern winter solstice during spin-up and at steady state. Problems with our simulations include peak latitudinal temperature gradients and zonal winds occurring ∼60. km lower than observed by Cassini CIRS, and no reduction in zonal wind speed around 80. km, as was observed by Huygens. While the latter may have been due to transient effects (e.g. gravity waves), the former suggests that our low (∼420. km) model top is adversely affecting the circulation near the jet peak, and/or that we require active haze transport in order to correctly model heating rates and thus the circulation. Future work will include running the model with a higher top, and including advection of a haze particle size distribution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Saturn's moon Titan has a dense atmosphere, but its thermal structure is poorly known. Conflicting information has been gathered on the nature, extent and evolution of Titan's planetary boundary layer-the layer of the atmosphere that is influenced by the surface-fromradio-occultation observations by the Voyager 1 spacecraft(1) and the Cassini orbiter(2), measurements by the Huygens probe(3-5) and by dune-spacing analyses(6). Specifically, initial analyses of the Huygens data suggested a boundary layer of 300 m depth with no diurnal evolution(4), incompatible with alternative estimates of 2-3 km (refs 1,2,6). Here we use a three-dimensional general circulation model(7), albeit not explicitly simulating the methane cycle, to analyse the dynamics leading to the thermal profile of Titan's lowermost atmosphere. In our simulations, a convective boundary layer develops in the course of the day, rising to an altitude of 800 m. In addition, a seasonal boundary of 2 km depth is produced by the reversal of the Hadley cell at the equinox, with a dramatic impact on atmospheric circulation. We interpret fog that had been discovered at Titan's south pole earlier(8) as boundary layer clouds. We conclude that Titan's troposphere is well structured, featuring two boundary layers that control wind patterns, dune spacing and cloud formation at low altitudes.},

abstract = {The Electron Spectrometer (ELS), one of the sensors making up the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) revealed the existence of numerous negative ions in Titan's upper atmosphere.

We present the first ionospheric model of Titan including negative ion chemistry. We find that dissociative electron attachment to neutral molecules (mostly HCN) initiates the formation of negative ions. The negative charge is then transferred to more acidic molecules such as HC3N, HC5N or C4H2. Loss occurs through associative detachment with radicals (H and CH3). We attribute the three low mass peaks observed by ELS to CN−, C3N−/C4H− and C5N−. These species are the first intermediates in the formation of the even larger negative ions observed by ELS, which are most likely the precursors to the aerosols observed at lower altitudes.},

abstract = {Cassini's third and fourth radar flybys, T7 and T8, covered diverse terrains in the high southern and equatorial latitudes, respectively. The T7 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) swath is somewhat more straightforward to understand in terms of a progressive poleward descent from a high, dissected, and partly hilly terrain down to a low flat plain with embayments and deposits suggestive of the past or even current presence of hydrocarbon liquids. The T8 swath is dominated by dunes likely made of organic solids, but also contain somewhat enigmatic, probably tectonic, features that may be partly buried or degraded by erosion or relaxation in a thin crust. The dark areas in T7 show no dune morphology, unlike the dark areas in T8, but are radiometrically warm like the dunes. The Huygens landing site lies on the edge of the T8 swath; correlation of the radar and Huygens DISR images allows accurate determination of its coordinates, and indicates that to the north of the landing site sit two large longitudinal dunes. Indeed, had the Huygens probe trajectory been just 10 km north of where it actually was, images of large sand dunes would have been returned in place of the fluvially dissected terrain actually seen—illustrating the strong diversity of Titan's landscapes even at local scales.},

abstract = {Hundreds of lakes and a few seas of liquid hydrocarbons have been observed by the Cassini spacecraft to cover the polar regions of Titan. A significant fraction of these lakes or seas could possibly be interconnected with subsurface liquid reservoirs of alkanes. In this paper, we investigate the interplay that would happen between a reservoir of liquid hydrocarbons located in Titan's subsurface and a hypothetical clathrate reservoir that progressively forms if the liquid mixture diffuses throughout a preexisting porous icy layer. To do so, we use a statistical-thermodynamic model in order to compute the composition of the clathrate reservoir that forms as a result of the progressive entrapping of the liquid mixture. This study shows that clathrate formation strongly fractionates the molecules between the liquid and the solid phases. Depending on whether the structures I or II clathrate forms, the present model predicts that the liquid reservoirs would be mainly composed of either propane or ethane, respectively. The other molecules present in the liquid are trapped in clathrates. Any river or lake emanating from subsurface liquid reservoirs that significantly interacted with clathrate reservoirs should present such composition. On the other hand, lakes and rivers sourced by precipitation should contain higher fractions of methane and nitrogen, as well as minor traces of argon and carbon monoxide. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we present all the high-resolution observations of the regions containing these transient features and the quantitative constraints that we derived from them. We argue that these features are unlikely to be SAR image artifacts or permanent geophysical structures and thus their appearance is the result of ephemeral phenomena on Titan. We find that the transient features are more consistent with floating and/or suspended solids, bubbles, and waves than tides, sea level change, or seafloor change and based on the frequency of these phenomena in terrestrial settings, we consider waves to be the most probable hypothesis. These transient features are the first instance of active processes in Titan's lakes and seas to be confirmed by multiple detections and demonstrate that Titan's seas are not stagnant but rather dynamic environments.},

abstract = {The iterative Wiener filter, which successively uses the{\$}\backslash{\$}nWiener-filtered signal as an improved prototype to update the covariance{\$}\backslash{\$}nestimates, is investigated. The convergence properties of this iterative{\$}\backslash{\$}nfilter are analyzed. It has been shown that this iterative process{\$}\backslash{\$}nconverges to a signal which does not correspond to the minimum{\$}\backslash{\$}nmean-squared-error solution. Based on the analysis, an alternate{\$}\backslash{\$}niterative filter is proposed to correct for the convergence error. The{\$}\backslash{\$}ntheoretical performance of the filter has been shown to give minimum{\$}\backslash{\$}nmean-squared error. In practical implementation when there is{\$}\backslash{\$}nunavoidable error in the covariance computation, the filter may still{\$}\backslash{\$}nresult in undesirable restoration. Its performance has been investigated{\$}\backslash{\$}nand a number of experiments in a practical setting were conducted to{\$}\backslash{\$}ndemonstrate its effectiveness},

abstract = {In order to investigate seasonal variations of the composition of Titan's low stratosphere, we developed a two-dimensional (latitude–altitude) photochemical and transport model. Large-scale advection, hidden in the vertical eddy diffusion for one-dimensional models, is accounted for explicitly. Atmospheric dynamics is prescribed using results of independent numerical simulations of the atmospheric general circulation. Both the mean meridional transport and latitudinal mixing by transient planetary waves are taken into account. Chemistry is based on 284 reactions involving 40 hydrocarbons and nitriles. Photodissociation rates are based on a three-dimensional description of the ultraviolet flux. For most species, the model fits well the latitudinal variations observed by Voyager I giving for the first time a full and self-consistent interpretation of these observations. In particular, the enrichment of the high northern latitudes is attributed to subsidence during the winter preceeding the Voyager encounter. Discrepancies are observed for C2H4, HC3N, and C2N2 and are attributed to problems in the chemical scheme. Sensitivity to dynamical parameters is investigated. The vertical eddy diffusion coefficient keeps an important role for the upper atmosphere. The wind strength and horizontal eddy diffusion strongly control the latitudinal behavior of the composition in the low stratosphere, while mean concentrations appear to be essentially controlled by chemistry.},

abstract = {The asteroid impact near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on 15 February 2013 was the largest airburst on Earth since the 1908 Tunguska event, causing a natural disaster in an area with a population exceeding one million. Because it occurred in an era with modern consumer electronics, field sensors, and laboratory techniques, unprecedented measurements were made of the impact event and the meteoroid that caused it. Here, we document the account of what happened, as understood now, using comprehensive data obtained from astronomy, planetary science, geophysics, meteorology, meteoritics, and cosmochemistry, and from social science surveys. A good understanding of the Chelyabinsk incident provides a unique opportunity to calibrate the event, with implications for the study of near-Earth objects and developing hazard mitigation strategies for planetary protection.},

@article{Porco2005,
abstract = {Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere. The atmosphere is poorly understood and obscures the surface, leading to intense speculation about Titan's nature. Here we present observations of Titan from the imaging science experiment onboard the Cassini spacecraft that address some of these issues. The images reveal intricate surface albedo features that suggest aeolian, tectonic and fluvial processes; they also show a few circular features that could be impact structures. These observations imply that substantial surface modification has occurred over Titan's history. We have not directly detected liquids on the surface to date. Convective clouds are found to be common near the south pole, and the motion of mid-latitude clouds consistently indicates eastward winds, from which we infer that the troposphere is rotating faster than the surface. A detached haze at an altitude of 500 km is 150-200 km higher than that observed by Voyager, and more tenuous haze layers are also resolved.},
