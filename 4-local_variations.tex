\section{Local and short-term variability of the detached haze layer}

So far, we have considered the evolution of the detached haze layer in the frame of the seasonal change.
We then discussed the long term-evolution at the planetary scale as a function of latitude.
In this section we consider sets of observations to characterize short-term and local behavior of the detached haze.
These characterizations could only be conducted on a limited number of observations and require very specific acquisition geometries. They allow us to observe localized, secondary order variations of the detached haze layer.
First, we choose several images taken a few hours apart to
evaluate the hourly variability of the detached haze. Next, we consider
observations at low phase angle which show simultaneously the two limbs of Titan. And, finally,
we consider observations taken from a near-polar point of view which can show
longitudinal variations in a narrow range of latitudes.
