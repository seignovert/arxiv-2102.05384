\section{Local and short term variabilities of the detached haze layer}

So far, we have considered the evolution of the detached in the frame of the seasonal change.
We then discussed the long term evolution at the planetary scale as function of the latitude.
In this section, we now consider sets of observations which allow to characterize specific
behavior of the detached haze. First, we choose several images taken few hours apart to
evaluate the variability of the detached haze layer at the scale of the hour. then, we consider
observations at low phase angle which show simultaneously the two limbs of Titan. And, finally,
we consider observations taken from a near polar point of view which enable to see the
longitudinal variations of the detached haze in a narrow range of latitudes.
