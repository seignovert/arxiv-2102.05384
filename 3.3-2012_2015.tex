\subsection{Period 3: Absence of DHL with sporadic transitory layers after the Northern Spring Equinox (2012-2015) - $L_s=\ang{30}-\ang{75}$}

During this period (Fig.~\ref{fig:dhl_2012_2015}), the main haze layer has large scale structures which slowly evolve under the influence of the
large scale circulation. The south and north polar hoods are still visible and they evolve
with time. Superimposed to this background haze, transient structures show up and disappear from one observation
to the other. At some moments, large scale detached hazes appear. They differ from the detached haze seen at the
beginning of the mission because they are not stable in time and in altitude.

In April 2012 (Fig.~\ref{fig:dhl_2012_2015}a), the detached haze has completely disappeared, except some residual
structures around the equator at 370 km.
These relicts of the last detached haze layer are almost not perceptible in the corresponding I/F profile. At other
latitudes, we only can see a unique main haze with a marked south polar hood and a small increase of extinction above
\ang{65}N that could be the north polar hood. Sometimes, detached layers emerge from the background with large latitudinal
extent (e.g. detached haze at 500 km Fig.~\ref{fig:dhl_2012_2015}b). However, they only remain for a short time
and are not seen in the following observations.

In August 2014 (Fig.~\ref{fig:dhl_2012_2015}c) we observed a plume of aerosol between \ang{10}S and \ang{25}N,
reaching 530 km. A detached haze layer seems to spread from this plume toward the north and the south. This
detached haze is around 500 km, descending to 470 km at \ang{60}S (and probably even southern). At the
north, the detached haze does not extend northern than \ang{50}N and remains at 500 km. This indicate an
atmosphere circulation rather flowing from equator toward the south pole. The origin of these aerosols seems to come
from the equatorial part of the main haze.

Overall, most of the observations between 2012 and the end of 2015 are featureless like the figure~\ref{fig:dhl_2012_2015}d)
taken in October 2015. During this period, the main haze has a uniform scale height of 45 km and
with an homogeneous extinction at the planetary scale.
