\section{Seasonal cycle of the haze extinction}

In order to provide a detailed explanation of the complex latitudinal variability of the detached haze layer, we present
some of the key images that we have analyzed. Based on the previous work focus on the evolution of the detached haze in the
equatorial region \citep{West2018}, we define four different phases characteristic of the evolution of the detached haze layer.
Between 2004 and 2008, the DHL was stable in altitude and extinction.
Between 2008 and 2012, it settled, merged and finally disappeared in the main haze.
During the period 2012-2016, the DHL was not observed and only sporadic transitory layers showed up.
After 2016 and up to the end of Cassini mission, the DHL reappeared following a complex pattern.
The complete survey is performed along a period of time which represents about half a Titan year.
This is valuable because it encompasses the equinoctial transition period of 2009.
For each phase, we display the altitude and latitude distribution of the instantaneous haze extinction retrieved from intensities at the illuminated limb of Titan.
The same color scale is applied to all the panels in order to keep a consistent view on the whole dataset.
Locations where no data are available are left as blank areas on the panels.
