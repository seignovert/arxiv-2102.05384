\subsection{Comparison with UVIS occultations}

\cite{Koskinen2011} derived information on the mesosphere and thermosphere of Titan using UVIS stellar
occultations. The sensitivity to haze opacity of UVIS during a stellar occultation is much better than what ISS can achieve. However,
while ISS probes the light scattered by the detached haze layer, UVIS probes the light transmitted through a tangential
path at the limb. In both cases, an extinction profile can be retrieved. ISS can retrieve the extinction of the
particles which scatter light, and under assumptions concerning the phase function and the single scattering albedo \change{\citep{Seignovert2017, West2018}}.
On the other hand, UVIS is able to retrieve the total extinction from transmission with no assumption about the haze
particles. This difference is valuable because it may give information about the change in aerosol
size with altitude. In practice, ISS sensitivity is not sufficiently sensitive to probe above
the peak of the detached haze by more than a scale height.

Two of the UVIS occultation profiles, in 2008 and 2009 (T41 and T53 flybys), can be directly compared with ISS
observations at the same location and at the same period (Fig.~\ref{fig:uvis_iss}). The UVIS profiles are scaled to
offset the spectral dependence between ISS and UVIS effective wavelengths (338 nm and 1850-1900~\AA~respectively).
This offset is due to the spectral dependence of the extinction cross-sections and to the intrinsic
differences arising from comparing the extinction retrieved from scattering properties or from occultation
\citep[see.][]{Cours2011}.

\caption{Comparisons between ISS and UVIS extinction profiles before the equinox.
UVIS profiles are retrieved by \cite{Koskinen2011} during the T41 (2008/02/23) and T53 (2009/04/19) flybys.
ISS profiles are retrieved for the images N1585329510\_1 (2008/03/27) and
N1618568958\_1 (2009/04/16).
The UVIS profiles are scaled by a factor 0.15 to compensate the spectral dependence of the extinction
cross section and overlap ISS retrievals.}

\change{The two profile can be compare in the 450 to 550 km altitude range.
In the first case (Fig.~\ref{fig:uvis_iss}a), even if the profiles don't exactly overlaps, the ISS extinction profile presents a peak of extinction exactly at the same location as the one observed by UVIS. The drop, above and below the peak is more pronounced with ISS than with UVIS.
In the second case (Fig.~\ref{fig:uvis_iss}b), the two profiles presents a excellent agreement with each over in the 450 to 550 km altitude range.}

Considering that UVIS and ISS profiles are not taken simultaneously and
they don't probe the same longitude, the results of the previous section demonstrate that these differences are
consistent with the natural variabilities observed in the detached haze layer.
This comparison is then a good validation of our results concerning the extinction profiles of the detached haze.

Above 575 km, UVIS extinction profiles show the presence of a secondary layer at 610 km which is not detected by ISS.
\change{ISS is sensitive to the aerosols scattered throughout the limb, whereas UVIS observations probe the extinction along the tangential path.
Due to its stronger forward scattering peak, the large particles contribute more to the measured ISS scattering signal compared to the smaller particles, that scatter the light more isotropically. During an occultation, both, small and large particles, contribute to the UVIS extinction signal \citep{Cours2011}.}
In theory, the difference between UVIS and ISS above 575 km \change{could} reveal a change in aerosol size distribution.
\change{However}, this layer is located at altitudes where the signal to noise is low \change{where our model is no longer able to retrieve the extinction properly.}
Therefore, it is not possible to draw a safe conclusion from \change{the comparison between ISS and UVIS} profiles above 575 km.
