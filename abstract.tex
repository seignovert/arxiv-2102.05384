The 13 years of the Cassini mission provide a unique dataset monitoring
the evolution of Titanâ€™s atmosphere during almost half a Titan year
between the middle of the northern winter up to the northern summer solstice.
In this work we present a survey of the vertical extinction profiles retrieved
between 300 to 700 km with an atmospheric limb multiple scattering model.
We sampled the ISS NAC CL1-UV3 dataset on the entire Cassini mission,
from 2004 to the end of the mission in 2017.

The spatial and temporal variations observed bring new perspectives
on the cycle of the detached haze layer and its interaction with the dynamics.
